You know what I do is write for kids, and in fact, I'm probably the author for kids, you know in the United States.
And I always tell people that I don't want to seem like a scientist.
I can <unk> like farmer, or with leather leather and no one has chosen a farmer.
I'm here to talk to you about circles and <unk>
And you know that an epiphany is usually something that fell into you.
You just have to turn the apple out to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of complicated circle that I'm going to talk about.
My circle started in the <unk> in the middle school, in <unk> Ohio where I was the weird class.
When I went to bleed every week in the children's bathroom until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life for letting me go into the bathroom school room.
I did it in secret.
for three years.
And I had to go from the city.
I had a thumb, 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a lover -- and in the 1920s, I felt the need to start working in organizations fighting against AIDS.
About three or four years ago, half the night I got a phone call from that <unk> the <unk> lady who said, "I need to see you.
I'm <unk> that from adults never get to know us.
You could <unk> to Ohio and please bring that man that you already have found.
And I have to tell you that I have a <unk> cancer, and I would like you to stand up with this please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
And we went to see, we <unk> <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
And we found a place, the <unk> and the <unk> and <unk> her family, because it was needed to.
It's something we knew how to do.
And as the woman I wanted to <unk> as an adult came to <unk> became a box of cinders and it was put in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle there was closed, it had turned into a circle -- and that epiphany that I told you about became present in itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save the <unk>
And you know that that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs real and beauty, and I'm very happy that I talked about a lot of this.
It needs to -- needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important to me.
And through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and everything is interconnected.
I went for the first time about Antarctica about 10 years ago, and I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can be quickly, I was <unk> trying to understand what was in front of me.
I <unk> them around the water around 60 feet -- and I couldn't even more than thought about a <unk> on another <unk> snow year after year.
The <unk> are born when you fall out of the glaciers or the ice barriers to <unk>
Each iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some of them refuse to give up and they hold up to the end, whereas others can't get them more and <unk> in a <unk> <unk>
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> that are isolated separated and ourselves, as much as we see ourselves as a human <unk>
But the reality is the opposite.
As it melts as a <unk> I'm breathing up its atmosphere.
As we melts the iceberg releases fresh water in minerals that feeds many forms of life.
I come up to photograph these <unk> as if it took the portraits of my ancestors, so knowing that in these unique moments there are in that way, and they will not be going back to that way again.
It's not death when you're <unk> it's not an end, but a continuation of its way through the cycle of life.
Part of the ice from the <unk> which I photograph is very <unk> has a couple thousand years old.
And another part of the ice has over 100,000 years.
The last pictures I would like to show you is from a <unk> that I photographed at <unk> Greenland.
It's <unk> to actually witness a <unk> <unk>
Here it is.
You can see the left one little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your <unk> line.
You can see here, starting <unk> the boat has moved to the other side and the man is standing there.
This is a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> from the water about 120 feet or 40 meters.
This video is in real time.
And so <unk> the iceberg shows a different side of his personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979 the same day, exactly at the same moment, every one -- a baby. Okay.
So, two couples every one with a baby.
I don't want you to get too much on the details of conception, because if you stop thinking about the conception.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage I want you to imagine that, in one case, the chromosome is joined by the X X <unk>
And in the other case, the X chromosome is joined by the X X <unk>
Both of them, and it starts life.
We'll go back to them later.
In my activity in the ground to do two roles.
In one of my <unk> work with the history of anatomy.
I'm a <unk> for training and what I study in this case is the way people <unk> the anatomy -- which is, from human bodies and <unk> how they have considered body fluid -- the idea of <unk> what have thought about the body.
The other role that performance in my work is an activist, as a <unk> of patients or, as I say sometimes, <unk> people who are doctors.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical characteristics defy social norms.
I've been working on, for example, with fraternal twins two people inside one body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people who are much lower than the average.
And I've worked with a lot of cases of people with <unk> sex in individuals whose physical fusion doesn't fit into the male <unk> and conventional feminine <unk>
In general, we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> embraces many ways.
I'm going to give you a few examples of having a sex that doesn't fall in the male or a <unk>
For example, it's the case of the individual with <unk> <unk> whose gene <unk> from the chromosome and says to the <unk> that we all have in the life that we all have in the life that they become <unk>
And then, in the <unk> life, the testes produce testosterone.
But because this individual lacks <unk> <unk> the body doesn't react to itself.
It's the <unk> syndrome.
So, there's high levels of testosterone but without reaction.
As a consequence, the body develops following a course as a <unk> course.
When I <unk> the baby has a little bit of a little girl.
It's a little girl. It's raised as a girl.
And often, it's not until puberty, when it's growing and developing the breast but it doesn't have the menstrual period, when someone realizes that something is happening.
After making tests realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> it actually has <unk> and a <unk>
The important thing to understand is that you can think about a man, but it's actually not that way.
Women like men, like men, we have in the body something called <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the <unk> hormone.
Most women like me -- I consider a <unk> woman. It doesn't know his <unk> structure, I believe being a typical woman -- most women like me are sensitive to the <unk>
We create <unk> and we respond to the <unk>
As a consequence, someone like me has the most exposed brain to the <unk> than the woman who was born with <unk> who has the <unk> syndrome.
So sex is a complicated thing, it's not that <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in some form can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago I got a call from a 19 boy who was born and raised as <unk> she had girlfriend, and with sex with her, I had a life like a boy and just found out that he had <unk> and <unk>
It was an extreme way of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
It had the 20th chromosomes and the <unk> <unk> <unk> that were so energetic, that essentially creating a male hormone <unk>
As a consequence, his <unk> were <unk> their brain was exposed to the hormone component typically male.
He was born with <unk> <unk> <unk>
And it was the age of 19 when he started having medical problems caused by the internal <unk> when the doctors found that in fact, it was women inside.
Well, another quick example of a case of <unk>
Some people with the 20th chromosomes develop what is known as <unk> is, they have <unk> tissue, wrapped up in <unk> tissue.
We don't know why that happens.
So, there's a lot of sex.
The reason that children with this kind of bodies -- so that is <unk> fraternal twins or <unk> <unk> <unk> surgery is not to be able to have a better sense of physical health.
In many cases, people are perfectly healthy.
The reason for which they were <unk> for several surgeries is that it's a threat to our social categories.
The system is based on the idea that a particular anatomy brings <unk> a particular identity.
We have the idea that being woman is to have <unk> identity -- it means to have African anatomy in terms of historical terms.
Very simplistic idea.
And when you have a body that shows something quite different, we have problems with <unk>
So we have very <unk> ideas in our culture about <unk>
Our nation is based on a concept of the <unk> very romantic.
So imagine the amazing thing that is having children are born like two people inside one body.
The highest case is last year with the South African <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> in the <unk> <unk>
A lot of journalists called to wonder: "What a test are going to do to figure out if <unk> <unk> is a man or <unk>
And I had to explain to the journalists that there is no <unk>
In fact, we now know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't plot a <unk> line between men and women or between men and <unk> and women and <unk> are we who we map that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more the more we get the more and more we have to admit that these categories -- and we thought were <unk> <unk> categories that are much more <unk> than they <unk>
And not just in terms of sex.
Also in terms of race, something that is much more complicated than the terminology <unk>
As we see, we go into a <unk> terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with the chimps.
What do you <unk> from the fact of the fact that they were just a few <unk>
And as we put in science and more and more in a very awkward area where we have to recognize that <unk> categories that <unk> probably are too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all the spheres of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States today, are the struggles at the beginning and the end of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which a body becomes human and has different rights.
There are very <unk> discussions today <unk> not public, but I know within the <unk> to when someone is considered died.
Our ancestors never had to deal with this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of you put it up a pen in front of your nose, and if he moved still the <unk>
If I stopped moving the <unk>
But today, we can, for example, extract vital organs from a body and put them on another body.
And as a result, we need to deal with a dilemma of really determining somebody's death, and this puts us in a difficult situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And you might think that this explosion of categories could be happy to someone like me.
In politics I'm liberal, you know, <unk> people with unusual objects, but I have to admit that I put it nervous.
And so we found that these categories are much more fragile than we thought about <unk>
<unk> from the concept of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension -- I have to admit that I'm a fervent fan of Parents <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and fearless and so radical in what they did, that I find myself every single watching that musical <unk> music, and not by the music, which is totally <unk>
It's because of what happened in <unk> with parents <unk>
Parents were <unk> to me, the first activists in the anatomy and explain why.
What they <unk> was a <unk> concept.
And as everybody remember, what we <unk> our parents -- <unk> was the idea of <unk> the monarchy was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The old ones of the old world didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were from the idea that the political power was coming through the <unk> of the grandfather to the father and then the son, etc.
Parents <unk> rejected that idea and replaced it for a new <unk> concept, and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They <unk> the game field, and they decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy in common and not the <unk> differences, that was a very radical thing.
And in part they were doing it because they were part of a <unk> system where they were <unk> two things.
It was <unk> democracy and at the same time <unk> science.
And it stays very clear, if you look at the history of <unk> <unk> that many were very interested in science and the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> from the <unk> explanations and therefore <unk> the concept of power <unk> passed away from a vague idea of birth.
They were moving towards a <unk> concept.
And if you look at the Declaration of <unk> you talk about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And in a result, we were broadcasting the idea of <unk> <unk>
And in doing so, they were <unk> the foundations of the future movement movement movement.
They didn't think that way, but it was really cool.
And what happened next?
And women <unk>
Then came the success of the Civil Rights movement with people from the <unk> <unk> <unk> saying, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the rows of the Civil Rights movement, saying, "I'm a man."
And again, people of color that we get to the <unk> <unk> about the difference -- and again, <unk>
We see the same thing with the <unk> movement.
The problem is, of course, as we look at the <unk> we have to start asking us why we keep certain <unk>
But you know, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For example, I don't want to give a fish the same rights to a human.
I don't want to say that we had to blame anatomy.
I don't want to say that the five year-old kids had to allow them to have sex and get married.
There are some <unk> <unk> that for me make sense and that I think we should be <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why they keep them and if they make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two <unk> <unk> at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> in the <unk> of 1979 exactly the same day.
Imagine that one of them, <unk> was born three months before time -- June 1, 1980.
Henry, on the contrary, was born, was born on the March 1 of March 1980.
For the only fact that I was born three months before Mary are attributed to all the rights three months before Henry -- the right to sexual consent, the right to vote, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all that not because it has a different material, but it was born later.
We found other <unk> relative to their rights.
So Henry, by virtue of being considered man, if I haven't told you if it's <unk> by virtue of being considered a man now is <unk> from the <unk> <unk> that Mary doesn't have to worry about.
Mary. I don't have the same rights of marriage that Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can marry all the states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman in some states.
So still <unk> categories that in various ways are <unk> and questionable.
And now the question is, what do we do now that science moved so much in the field of anatomy that we get to the point of having to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy could be <unk>
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time sometimes I feel like science <unk>
Where do we go from here?
It seems that what happens in our culture is sort of a kind of <unk> attitude -- "Well, we have to draw the line in some part, so we're going to do."
But a lot of people are stuck in a strange position.
For example, Texas at some point has decided that to get married with a man -- you don't have to be able to be <unk> and to get married with a woman.
Now, in practice, they don't make tests to get people <unk>
But this is also very strange given the story that I told you at the beginning of the <unk> <unk>
If you look at one of the founders of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his <unk> speech. <unk> <unk> offers a solution.
It says that we should judge people in <unk> not in the color of their skin, but in the contents of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yes, the idea seems <unk>
But in practice, how do you do it?
How do you judge people based on the base of their <unk>
I want to point out also that I'm not sure that we had to focus on this for <unk> rights to people, because I have to admit that I know some <unk> <unk> that probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> that I know can make more intelligent <unk> decisions and <unk> about their sex relations that I know.
So how do you put the theme of the content of <unk>
It turns out very hard.
And one part of me asks what if the character of a person could be measured with an instrument, maybe with an MRI machine.
We want to actually get to that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems like it seems to be very important that the United States is still pushing this current thinking into the issue of democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like the Iranian and a man who feels attracted to other men is susceptible to be <unk> unless they are willing to tell a sex change in which case you can live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm happy to say that we don't have a context as a surgeon that I talked about a couple of years ago that I had made the <unk> twins <unk> and then pick it up, and they <unk> his fame.
But when the phone asked him the <unk> of the operation -- he was a very <unk> operation, to me that in that other country these children would be very <unk> and so I had to do it.
What I said, "Well, have the political asylum rather than the <unk> <unk>
The United States offers huge possibilities for people to be who are <unk> to change the very well of the state.
So I think we have to be in the head.
Well, to finish I mean I've been talking a lot about <unk>
And I want to think about what democracy, or as it might have been, if we had given more involvement in <unk>
And I want to say something a little radical for a <unk> and it is that I think there may be different ideas from different <unk> <unk> particularly if there are people thinking about a group.
For years, since I've been interested in the <unk> I've been interested in looking at the sexual difference.
And one of the things that has been interested in is the differences between men and women in the way to think and operate in the world.
And what we know about <unk> studies is that women, on average, not all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and care about those who are <unk> inside the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
And so when I was in graduate school, one of my advisers who knew I was interested in Feminism <unk> I considered me <unk> as a <unk> made me a <unk> <unk>
<unk> what about female <unk>
And I thought, "It's the most stupid question I've heard.
Feminism has to do with unpicking the stereotypes of gender, so there is nothing female in the <unk>
But the more I thought about your question, most of you have to have a little female in the <unk>
I mean, there might be something, on average, something different between the brains and the male that makes us more <unk> to the complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So while parents were very attentive to find the way to protect the people in the state, it's possible that they had to have more <unk> to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection with <unk>
And maybe that's what we have to do in the future when we bring the democracy beyond <unk> thinking less in the individual body, in terms of identity, and think more about relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect <unk> we think about what we do for each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided that we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when each family thinks where they want to go live and work, have the possibility of choosing between at least a handful of different cities that are competing for attracting new residents.
Well, at this moment we're far away from that goal.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't count on a single city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that it's worth a lot more than their building cost.
So we could easily spread the world together, maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may be ridiculous if you have never thought about new cities.
But it just <unk> by the buildings of apartments.
So imagine that half of those who wanted to live in the apartment already were owners and the other half is still not <unk> to do that.
You could try to increase the ability to increase <unk> in all the existing buildings.
But you know the problem that <unk> is that those buildings and the areas around the surround have rules to avoid the <unk> and building the building together.
So it would be very difficult to do all those <unk>
But you could go to a whole new place, building a whole building of apartment -- totally new apartments and when the rules of that place to make the construction instead of putting it in.
So I proposed that governments are going to <unk> new market zones big enough to contain cities and gave them a name, cities under <unk>
Later I learned that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of Honduras.
They knew that every year about 75,000 <unk> they would come out of their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could do to stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009, I went through a constitutional crisis.
In the following elections -- <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> with a platform in which we <unk> reforms and at the same time reconciliation.
He asked her to <unk> who was his head of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk at TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a lot of evidence with users, tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to their most essential.
The first point was the importance of the rules, like those rules that say that you can't go and pay all the current residents of apartments.
They spend a lot of attention to new technologies, but we need both of technologies like <unk> and often are the rules that keep us forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala sent <unk> a link with the <unk>
I showed it to <unk>
They had me.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met in Miami, in a conference conference room.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable cities are more valuable than their cost.
And I used this picture that shows the value of the land in a place like New York City, land that in some cases, are worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract argument, and at some point, when there was a pause, <unk> said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of <unk> talk.
And the talk described in very simple terms that a city under <unk> is a place where you start with <unk> terrain -- a <unk> that <unk> the rules that will be <unk> and a choice that people can choose if they want to go or not live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> was called, and he told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this might be the way that our country is going forward.
He asked me to be <unk> and I would talk about New York and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included an image like this, that trying to explain that to make a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
Only this airport cover over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, you have to start with a site that is about the least 3,000 square miles.
That's over 100,000 acres.
Everybody <unk> <unk>
The faces of the audience were very serious and <unk>
The Congress leader came up to the platform, and he said, "Professor <unk> thank you so much for his talk, but maybe we could see the video of <unk> talk.
I have it here in my <unk>
So I sat down and showed the <unk>
And this explained that a new city can offer new choices for people.
There would be a choice of a city that might be able to go in <unk> instead of hundreds of miles away to the North.
And we also <unk> new options for leaders.
Because the leaders of the government of government would need help from <unk> countries -- could benefit from the countries associated with them to help them establish and make the rules of the <unk> so that they could all trust that the <unk> effectively <unk>
We went and saw a site.
This photo is there.
It could basically cover a thousand square miles.
And soon after, the 19 of January, they voted in Congress to <unk> his Constitution and add a constitutional facility that allowed to create these special special regions of development.
In a country that I had just passed through this <unk> crisis, voting in Congress in favor of this constitutional constitutional <unk>
All of the parties, all the <unk> in society, the <unk>
For <unk> in the <unk> you have to pass twice in Congress.
On 17 <unk> passed over again in another voting -- to <unk>
Immediately after the <unk> of the 21st of February, a <unk> <unk> went to the two places in the world that are more interested in engaging in building cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new <unk> center in the city that is building in North Korea, is larger than the center of Boston.
Everything you see there was built in four years, after they spent four years getting the <unk>
The other country is interested in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've built two cities in China and they're preparing for a third.
And if you think about this <unk> this is the point where we are.
They have a place, and you're thinking about a site for the second city.
They are preparing a legal system that would allow the managers to <unk> and then enable it to operate under an external legal system.
A country has been committed to allow his Supreme Court to be the court of the last instance for this new <unk> system.
There are urban urban <unk> which are very interested in the project.
You can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know that you've solved is that they have a good number of inhabitants.
There are a lot of companies who wanted to be installed in <unk> especially in a place with a free trade, and there are a lot of people who would like to go to live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would change immediately somewhere else.
There's a million a year that comes out of Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave their family to go back to get a job -- sometimes they are mothers, who have to earn the money for just eating or buy clothes.
Unfortunately, even there are even kids who are trying to meet with their parents who haven't seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what do you think about building a new city in <unk>
Or do you build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these around the world?
What do you think about insist that families can choose between various cities that are competing for attracting new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends <unk> I was asked to say, "Thank you."
I'm a <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what there is in the inside, I'm going to make a confession public and is that I live obsessed with <unk>
I love to find, and more recently, photograph and post my blog <unk> and so different for every time.
But I don't buy anything new.
My whole clothes is <unk> and <unk> markets and <unk> <unk>
Oh, thank you.
The second hand stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment, and in my <unk>
I go to meet people -- I'm going to meet you for the general <unk> my money is going to a good <unk> My guess is <unk> and buying it into my search for <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
It will be my size?
I'll like <unk>
It will cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I feel that I've won.
To go back to my <unk> I want to tell you what I <unk> for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what does it bring to someone who has all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I suit.
I've brought seven pairs of clothing and nothing else.
<unk> inside exactly a week is everything I've put in my <unk>
I thought I would be able to find everything else I want to use after you get here to Palm <unk>
And since I don't know me as the woman who walks for TED in the TED <unk>  that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the sets for this week.
It doesn't sound interesting?
While I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that believe it or not, I've learned in this adventure of not using new clothing.
Let's start with Sunday.
I call this tiger tiger,
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look good.
You will almost always see this phenomenal for less than 50 dollars.
All the together, including <unk> it took me <unk> and it's the most expensive thing that I've used in the week.
<unk> color is energy.
It's almost <unk> impossible to be <unk> when you're wearing a brilliant red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
<unk> <unk> is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time.
I just know yourself.
If you get rid of the right people -- not just <unk> you are <unk>
<unk> <unk> of the child that you're inside.
Sometimes people tell me that it seems like I play the <unk> or I remember your little <unk>
I like to <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> <unk> is the key.
If you think you see you well with something, it's almost sure you are.
And if you think you don't see you well with something, it's probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until 30 years that really understood its meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person on your inside and outside, you don't look at you you can't <unk>
So there's no excuse for anybody in this audience.
We must be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> A universal universal -- six words for you: <unk> <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal and unique way of telling the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tested it over and over again when people would close to me this week just by what I was using, and we had fantastic conversations there.
Obviously this is not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home to Brooklyn, I'm going to donate it all.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that you have to leave certain things.
I don't need to be emotionally emotionally in these things, because at the way around the corner, there will always be another crazy suit -- <unk> and brilliant <unk> if there is a little love in my heart and after.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can split in two parts.
The left side, which is the logic of it, and the right side, which is the intuitive part.
So if you put a scale to measure the <unk> of every <unk> we could design a blueprint for our brain.
For example, this would be someone that is completely logical.
This would be someone who's totally intuitive.
So where do you look at your brain at this scale?
Some of them <unk> for one of these ends, but I think for most of the members of this audience, their brain is something -- with a great <unk> in both <unk> at the same time.
It's not that it's mutually <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people, as well as most of the other quantum physicists -- we need a lot of logic to deal with these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need pretty intuition to make the experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We put ourselves into play with them, and then we see as <unk> and then we develop our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
And as a kind of intuition that you can have developed with the step of the years is that one thing is going to be just one place at once.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you didn't work with this <unk> the <unk>
I remember looking at a kid playing a parking bar.
It was a small child, and I didn't do it very well, it always <unk>
But I bet you play with that parking bar bar I showed him a valuable lesson, and that is that the big things not allow the <unk> to stay in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that you can have in the world, except you're a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particles, because they don't play with parking bars and play with these strange little particles.
And when they play with your particles, they discover that they do all kinds of really rare things, like they can go through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they were called theory of quantum mechanics.
At that point, it was the physics of a few years ago; you need of quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But you didn't need to describe the big objects around us every day.
That didn't fit very well for my intuition, and maybe it's because they don't play very often with particles.
Well, sometimes play with them, but not very much.
And I've never seen them.
I mean, no one saw a <unk>
But it didn't fit well to my logical part either.
Because if it's all made of little particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, then it shouldn't all go on the early <unk> of the mechanical <unk>
I don't find the reason why he didn't have.
And therefore I would feel much better if I could somehow prove that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I set up doing exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see that has been in a <unk> <unk>
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the little piece of metal that I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to zoom in a little bit. It's found right in the center.
And then here we do a great deal with the little metal <unk>
What we see is a little bit of metal <unk> and that stands up on a platform.
And so I did this almost the same way that you would do a computer chip.
I went to a room clean with a new silicon chip, and I started working all the big machines around 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this hole in a swimming way, which is underneath the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum imagination, but it needs a little bit of help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how awkward it is to be in an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I am on an elevator alone, I do all kinds of weird, but then when other people get up, you stop doing those things, because I don't want them to <unk> or actually <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The <unk> of inanimate objects are not just people, it's also the light that <unk> it and the wind that happens to their side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little piece of metal to be <unk> according to quantum mechanics, we would have to keep all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
<unk> the lights and then <unk> a <unk> and pulled out all the air, and then it took it to a temperature of less than a degree on absolute zero.
Now, when we are just in the <unk> the little piece of metal is free to act as hard.
So we measure their movements.
We found it moving into very weird ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, he was vibrating. And the way it <unk> was like a breathing in this way -- like a <unk> that expands and <unk>
And by giving it a soft <unk> we could make it <unk> and not <unk> at the same time -- something that just happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you about is something really fantastic.
What does it mean that a <unk> thing, and not <unk>
Let's think about atoms.
In one case, all the trillion atoms that make that piece of metal are still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down and down.
It's just in certain <unk> when those are <unk>
In the rest of the time they're <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which means that all the piece of metal is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Seriously.
<unk> <unk> in a bus room to do this for all those years, because, watch this, the difference on scale between one atom and that little piece of metal is sort of more or less the same as the difference between that little metal and you.
So if one single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places, why don't you as well?
I mean, it's my piece of logic that he speech.
So imagine if you were in a number of places at the same time, how would you be that?
How do you act your consciousness if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it's when we put it down, and we turned the lights together and we looked inside the box, we saw that the metal was still there in a single piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, seemingly all the objects on the elevator are actually just quantum objects that are simply <unk> in a small space.
You hear a lot about how much quantum mechanics -- claims everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not so much.
It's more than that, it's more profound.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things around you, literally define who you are, and that's the deep queerness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And then 18 months ago, I was doing another work at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something with museums and art to my head that is here and that allowed me to get it.
It took me 18 months and it took me.
A lot of negotiations and stories, it was about 17 very interesting museums in nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on the <unk>
There's a lot of stories about why we did.
I think my own story is explaining just on this slide and this is the access.
I grew up in India.
I had a great education of education -- I don't have a lot of access to a lot of these museums and works of art.
So when I started traveling and going to museums, I started learning a lot.
And working at Google, I try to make the desire to make it more accessible through technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
You'd better show the demo to then explain to you a couple of interesting things that we have done from their launch.
So let's go to <unk>
Look around all the museums that there is.
There's the <unk> gallery at MoMA, the <unk> the <unk> the <unk>
I'm actually going to go into one of my favorites, <unk> the art museum in New York City.
There are two ways to do it -- very simple.
We click and <unk> we are inside the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that doesn't really matter.
You move around and they <unk>
They want to navigate the <unk>
We open the <unk> and with a single click, we jumped inside.
You're inside, that you want to go at the end of the hospital.
Go ahead and do it <unk>
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't come to the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of Pieter <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk> sign.
If the museum shows us the image, we click there.
See, this is one of the images.
Here is all the <unk> information.
For those of you who are truly interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click here right now.
And this is one of the pictures we've captured in what we call the <unk> technology.
So this image, for example, <unk> I think, about 10,000 million <unk>
And there are a lot of people who ask me, "What do you get 10,000 million <unk>
So I'm going to show you what you really get with 10,000 million pixels.
It can zoom around in a very simple way.
You see some fun things that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression.
But if you really want to <unk>
So I started to play, and I found myself with something going on there.
And I said, "A moment, this seems <unk>
I went in, and I found that kids were actually playing something.
I did a little bit, I talked to some people from the <unk> and I actually discovered that this is a game called <unk> which is to hit a <unk> with a Tuesday Tuesday Tuesday Tuesday <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get even more deep, and you'll see that you can actually get to the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to move the image, so you see what there is.
Here's where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is to come, a second.
So now we're going to go back again at MoMA, in New York City.
Here's another one of my favorites, <unk>
The example I showed was to find details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how van <unk> actually created this <unk>
It goes up and they really get it out.
I'm going to one of my favorite parts in this picture, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is the <unk> I think I had never seen it before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There are lots of things here, but I don't have time to <unk>
This is the really cool part. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely everyone, no matter if you're rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives it the same.
You can go online to create your own museum, create your own collection from all these images.
It's very simple, we walked in, I've created this function I call "The <unk> of <unk> -- we just made a <unk>
It is about <unk> at the National Gallery in London.
You can make things, send you to your friends and keep a conversation about what they feel at contemplating these <unk> works.
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main thing is that all the amazing things don't come from Google.
No, in my opinion, they even don't come from the museums.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
Actually, they come from those artists.
And that's been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital medium to do the work of art and it's represented properly online.
And the big question that I do today is: "You do this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It is to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
I have something to show you.
Think of it is a <unk> a <unk>
In our lab, we call it responsive design.
I'll tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I'm from <unk> Italian all the children in Italy grow up with this photo on the wall of his bedroom. But the reason I show you this is a very interesting thing on the careers of <unk> one in the last two decades.
There was some time, if you wanted to win a career of Formula 1, you took a budget and you put it into a good pilot and a good car, a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, you won the race.
This is what in engineering, it was <unk> control system in real time.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
Today what's interesting is that real-time control systems are starting to go into our lives.
Our cities, over the last few years, have been covered in networks and electronics there.
They're coming into the outdoor <unk>
And as <unk> are starting to respond in a different way, and they can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As a note I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the cortex of the planet, but they represent 50 percent of the <unk> population.
75 percent of the consumption of <unk> and to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are moving into our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibit of <unk> <unk> for <unk> during MoMA, during the summer.
It's called <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, start to <unk>
And in a way, it's like almost all of the existing atoms were sent sensors and <unk>
And that's completely changing the interaction that as humans have with the outside environment.
It is almost like the old dream of Miguel <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> says that at the end he took the hammer and he threw it up to the Moses -- you can actually see a little dent in the <unk> and he said, <unk> <unk> in <unk> -- and he said, <unk> <unk>
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just some <unk> <unk> in the idea of getting the environment and push something.
Let's start with the detection
The first project I wanted to share with you is really one of the first projects of our lab.
This was four and a half years ago in Italy.
It was a summer, hopefully 2006.
It was the year that Italy won the World Cup <unk>
Maybe some of you remember it, they played with Italy and France, and at the end, <unk> gave the <unk>
And anyway, I won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day by looking at the <unk> activity in the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the <unk> River.
It's the morning, before play.
The time line is at the top.
By the early evening there are people over here and there are called <unk>
It starts the <unk> silence.
<unk> from France.
<unk> people do a quick call.
Second time. End of time.
<unk> <unk> second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
<unk> Italy, yeah!
That night they all went down to the center.
There you see the big <unk>
The next day they all went to the center of the winning team and the prime minister then.
And then everybody <unk>
You see the picture of the place called <unk> <unk> where, since the <unk> people are going to <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we wouldn't have been able to do a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> is not about people, but things we use and consume them.
Today we know everything about the provenance of our objects.
This is a map that shows all the chips that make up a Mac, how do you <unk>
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project, we developed a little bit of small tags to track the trash in its <unk>
We started with some volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little bit more about a year to tag what they were <unk> different kinds of things, as you can see, things that all of all <unk>
And then we put a little chip, and we put a little <unk> and then we started <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
<unk>
And after a week.
With this information we realized that there are lots of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same thing with a lot less energy.
These are data that didn't exist before.
There are really complicated things and there's a lot of <unk>
But the other thing that we believe is that if we look at every day that the cup that <unk> it doesn't know that it's still somewhere on the planet.
If the plastic bottle of plastic that if the plastic bottle we <unk>
And if we show that to people, then we can promote some change in <unk>
That was the reason of the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us a lot more about detecting and a lot of great things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part we talked at the very beginning, which is <unk>
And the first project is something we did a couple years ago in <unk>
It all started with a question of mayor of the city, which came and told us that Spain and south of Europe have a beautiful tradition of water use in public spaces, in the architecture.
And the question was, how can technology figure out, new technology, join that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a shop was, imagine that they have a <unk> and <unk> valves <unk> <unk> that open up and <unk>
It believed like a curtain of water with the pixels of water.
If you fall the pixels you can write in them, show patterns, images, texts.
And when we zoom in, the curtain will open up so that we can happen, as you see in the image.
We introduced this to the mayor of <unk>
It liked a lot of it.
And we had a commission to design the building into the entrance to the <unk>
We call it <unk>
The whole building is made of water.
There is no doors and no windows, but when you're trying to open up so you can see it.
The ceiling is also covered in water.
And if there's a bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> the <unk>
Or you can close the building and all architecture disappears like this case.
Those days always will be someone, in the winter, when you go down the roof, someone who was there and said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that you've got it, but when it goes down almost all the architecture goes away.
So here's how it works.
You see the <unk> people on what happens inside.
And here I'm myself trying to do not <unk> the <unk> the sensors open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was actually even more fun.
All the children from <unk> came to the building because the way of interacting it had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that would open to leave you -- but a building that was still doing <unk> and holes of water and one had to jump out for not <unk>
<unk> <unk> And for us that was very interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, we always think about the use of people to give our designs.
But then the reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things that people use.
This is a picture of the building with the physical <unk> the <unk> of water and of projections on them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
So imagine that those pixels could start flying.
So imagine that they could have little helicopters in the air, and that each one had a tiny pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud moving in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, like the one that we saw earlier, moving with others in synchrony.
Could we form this cloud, a <unk>
A kind of flexible screen like this with a normal configuration in two dimensions.
Or in three dimensions, but in three dimensions, where it changes is light, not the position of the pixel position.
You can play with a different guy.
So imagine that the screen appear in different scales and sizes, in different kinds of resolution.
And then all of that could be a piece of pixels in 3D that you can get anywhere near and <unk> and see from very different perspectives.
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like before.
When the light lights up, you see this. The same thing we saw before.
So imagine each of them being able to be used by a person.
We can have each pixel with a input that comes from people, the movement of people, and so on.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best <unk> dancers today, the star of the <unk> of New York and <unk> <unk> to capture their movements in 3D and use it as input for <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left you see the <unk> the <unk> in different <unk>
It's so <unk> 3D <unk> as a movement capture.
It can get all the movement.
You can go all the way.
And once we have the pixels we can play with them, with the color and the movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a possible input for <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project that we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could engage people in order to do something and change our <unk> environment, like a <unk> farm -- but with a cloud.
So imagine that we could make everyone <unk> a little bit for a <unk>
And I think what remarkable has happened in the last two years is that, in the last two decades, we moved from the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything like knowledge, and it's accessible through the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign is <unk> we can move from the digital world of the <unk> power of networks, to the physical world.
In our case, this may want to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow it may be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions. How can we move from the digital world to the physical world.
The idea is that we can make people involves doing this together, in a collective way.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that the actual cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are pixel in our cloud up.
It's a physical structure in London, but cover of the pixel on the pixel screen.
You can move through it, have different experiences.
You can see from the bottom, to serve to share the main <unk> moments of 2012, and even more, and it can be used as a way of connection with the community.
So it's so much a physical cloud of the sky as something that you can go up as a new <unk> of London.
You can get into there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is to be a new experience for anyone who goes to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than what they are.
Suppose I told you that, with only some changes in your genes, you could improve the <unk> for one more accurate and faster.
Or maybe you might like to be in a better way, to be stronger to have more resistance.
Would you like to be more attractive and more attractive of themselves?
What about living more with good health?
Or maybe be those people who always wanted to be more creative.
What's the most <unk>
What would you want, if you could choose anything?
<unk> out of the Audience: <unk> <unk>
How many people do you know creativity?
Hands up, let me see.
<unk> probably had the number of creative people present.
That's very good.
How many of you would choose <unk>
A few more.
And the physical state.
A little less.
What about <unk>
Ah, most people, that makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have some of this the world would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe possibly possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> subject here at the TED conference but I want to give you the look of a doctor on the subject.
The great <unk> of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> which <unk> in the Church of <unk> <unk> wrote a trial called "Nothing in biology makes sense of the light of the <unk>
But if they actually accept biological evolution consider this: it's just about the past, or the future?
Is it about the other or <unk>
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, well at one end, is of course that interests us.
<unk> of a common ancestor with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.
We have been maybe 20 or 25 different species of <unk>
Some of them have gone and <unk>
We have been here about <unk> years.
It might seem that we are very far away from other parts of this tree of life, but actually mostly the basic machinery of our cells is roughly the same.
You realize that we can leverage and control the machinery of a common bacterium to produce the protein of human insulin that is used to treat <unk>
This is not like human insulin -- but it's the same protein, and it is the same protein, which comes out of <unk>
And talking about bacteria -- you realize that we all take in the gut of bacteria that we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think of -- when Antonio <unk> would tell you about <unk> you think about the <unk>
The gut is a beautifully <unk> environment, for those bacteria.
It's warm dark, <unk> is very <unk>
And we're going to give you all the nutrients that they can want to have no effort from their part.
It really is like a rapid pathway for the bacteria with the occasional disruption of some rush to <unk>
But therefore, we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential for our life.
They help digest nutrients to <unk> and protect us from certain diseases.
But what is the future?
We're in a sort of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or to become something different, something different, better <unk>
In this vast <unk> symphony of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, as one and only <unk> and human life, a little note of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> of this talk, so I hope that you've got it <unk>
When I just went to college, I had my first kind of biology.
I was fascinated by the elegance and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution and realized that in most of the existence of life, in the <unk> organisms that each cell is simply divide and all the genetic energy of that cell is broadcast to the two stem cells.
But when organisms are <unk> things start to change.
It goes into sexual reproduction.
And something very important -- with the emergence of sexual reproduction that happens the genome -- the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you might say that the <unk> of the body comes into evolution at the same moment of sexual reproduction.
I have to tell you that when I was a college student thinking, well, <unk> <unk> death -- it seemed pretty reasonable at that time, but with every year that was going on, every year I had more <unk>
I got to understand the feelings of George <unk> that still <unk> in Las Vegas in their 90 years.
And one night someone hits his hotel door to the hotel.
He opens the door.
And in front of him is a gorgeous <unk> <unk>
He looks at it and he says, <unk> looking for a <unk> <unk>
"Okay, she says George, "I chose <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working for a different goal to the goal of the <unk> not necessarily just to <unk> it just different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted you to stay healthy.
I wanted to regain the health of the disease.
I wanted we were living more and healthier.
Evolution is about switching the genome to the next <unk> adapting and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are like <unk> rockets designed to send the genetic charge to the next level, and then let us go to the sea.
I think they all <unk> the feeling that I put in Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want to make the immortality through my work.
I want to <unk> you don't know.
Evolution doesn't necessarily blame longevity.
It doesn't necessarily recognize the biggest or the stronger or the faster or even the most intelligent people.
Evolution favors the very good creatures adapted to their environment.
That's the only test for survival and successful.
At the bottom of the ocean the bacteria bacteria that can survive in the heat of the <unk> that <unk> if there were fish there, fish <unk> to the empty, yet they've managed to do that a <unk> environment.
So what does this mean when we look at what's happening in evolution and if we go back to thinking about the place of humans in evolution and, in particular, if we look ahead at the stage phase -- I would say there are lots of possibilities.
The first one is that you don't know.
We've got a kind of balance.
And the underlying reasoning would be that through medicine, first of all, we have known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and cut from the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment for us as well as we adapt to it.
And by the way, you know, <unk> <unk> and we have so much that it is no longer possible to have the necessary isolation that evolution happened.
A second possibility is that there is an evolution of the <unk> natural guy, dictated by the forces of nature.
And the argument here is that the gears of evolution roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And as soon as the <unk> as a <unk> planets are going to exist, the environmental changes that can produce evolution naturally.
But there's a third possibility, a potential and intriguing and frightening.
I call it <unk> the new evolution, which is not simply <unk> but <unk> and <unk> for us as individuals in the choices that we <unk>
Now, how could this happen?
How could we do this?
First of all, consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily a good thing for society, but it's what you choose to the individual and family level.
Think about it as well as possible to choose not only the sex of your <unk> but in your own body to make the genetic <unk> to cure or prevent disease.
And if we could do the genetic change to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's or reducing your cancer risk or eliminate the <unk>
You wouldn't want to do those changes in your <unk>
If we look at the future that kind of change is going to be increasingly possible.
The Human Genome Project, the Human Genome Project, and she sued 13 years old.
<unk> <unk> million dollars.
By the next year I finished, in 2004, I could do the same job for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
Now you can get a full sequence of the three billion base pairs of the human genome at a cost close to 20,000 and on a week.
Not a lot of the fact that the human genome is actually going to get the human genome by <unk> and being more and more to the grasp of all.
They come those changes.
The same technology that has produced human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not just going to protect ourselves from themselves, but they're going to do immunity against other viruses.
<unk> or there is no experimental trial in the course of the flu flu vaccine.
Can you imagine something nice to get out of the <unk>
That's actually today and the future is going to be increasingly possible.
Imagine then only other two little <unk>
You can change the cells of their bodies but if they could change the cells in their <unk>
And if you could change the sperm and the <unk> or change the <unk> <unk> and giving your children a better chance of a healthier life, eliminate diabetes, eliminating the risk of cancer?
Who don't want children more <unk>
And then, that same analytical technology, that same engine engine that can produce the changes for preventing disease is going to allow us to adopt <unk> <unk> a better memory.
Why not have the ingenuity of a Ken <unk> especially if you could relate to the next generation of the machine <unk>
Why not have a drill from <unk> faster than allowed us to run faster and more <unk>
Why don't we live longer?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we're in conditions of passing this to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes that we would have turned the evolution of before in <unk>
We're going to take a process that would normally take 100,000 years and we can get it to 1,000 years and maybe within the next 100 years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or grandchildren from their grandchildren, are going to have them.
We're going to use these choices to make a better society, more successful, more <unk>
Or are we going to be selectively <unk> different attributes that we want for some of us but not for the others?
We're going to build a society that is more boring and more robust and more robust and more robust and more robust and more robust <unk>
This is the kind of question that we're going to have to face.
And most profound of all, we're going to be able to develop wisdom and inherit the wisdom needed to make these <unk> decisions.
For good or for bad, and before what I could do, these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a big explosion when you're at 900 feet tall.
Imagine an airplane full of smoke.
Imagine a engine by doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> It sounds terrifying.
Well, I had a single seat that day. I was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one I could talk to the flight <unk>
So I looked at them, and they said, "There is no problem. You probably hit some <unk>
The pilot had already <unk> the airplane, and we weren't so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot <unk> the plane with Hudson River.
That's not the road.
It was the motors.
Imagine being in an airplane and without <unk>
And then three words said ...
The three words that I have heard.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk more with the flight <unk>
I was able to see it in his eyes,
It was terror. Life <unk>
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before they die, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people that I wanted to come in, and I didn't do it, all the fences that I wanted to have all the experiences that I have and never <unk>
As I thought about that further, I came to a phrase, which is, <unk> wines <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm going to open.
I don't want to <unk> anything in life.
And that urgency, that purpose, really changed my life.
The second thing I learned that day -- and this is while <unk> the bridge George Washington, which was not a lot -- I thought about, Whoa! I really feel a big <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity, and I tried to improve everything I did.
But in my humanity also gave rise to my ego.
And I'm sorry about the time that I would get in things that didn't matter with people who do matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then, as <unk> in that, I decided to eliminate the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I'm not trying to have <unk> <unk> to be <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is like your mental clock is like your mental clock is <unk>
See the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please <unk>
I don't want this to be <unk> in 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And as I <unk> I had the feeling of, wow, die will not fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for that all our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to <unk> I love my life.
And that sadness is <unk> in a single thought, which is just desire one thing.
I wish I could see my children grow up.
One month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade, not a lot of artistic talent.   And I scream, <unk> as a little boy.
And to me, that was the entire reason for being the world.
At that point, I got to connect those two points, which the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
For all, the only goal I have in life is a good father.
I was awarded a miracle, not to die that day.
And he gave me another gift, which was the possibility to look at the future and go back and live differently.
You are flying up today, the challenge that you can imagine the same thing on your airplane -- and please not be that -- but you can imagine, and how do you <unk>
What is that that you are expecting to do because they think they're going to live <unk>
How would their relationships change and negative energy in them?
And most importantly, they're the best parents to <unk>
Thank you.
I've clearly been <unk> in life with a lot of <unk> projects.
But the most great thing that I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> in the 1980s.
One day he came home after he went home and said, "Dad, I feel a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today, it has total <unk>
It can only use your eyes.
Her job influenced me.
I have a design company and animation here, so obviously, graffiti is a intricate thing that we admire and <unk> in the world of art.
So we decided that we were going to <unk> <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and met with his brother and her father and said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "Just want you to be able to talk to Tony again.
I just want to be able to communicate with him and that he's able to communicate to me."
And I said, "A second is not that I saw Stephen <unk> not that all people with paralysis can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you're someone important and have a good insurance you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do you communicate then?"
Anybody see the movie "The <unk> and the <unk>
They communicate that way -- they are doing it with your finger.
I said, "That's <unk> How can it be?"
So I was presented with the only desire to deliver a check, and instead signed a check that I didn't have the least idea of how I was going to <unk>
And she was <unk> with his brother and his father there at that precise moment, "All right, this is the <unk> Tony is going to talk, we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to make his art again.
Because it's ridiculous that someone who has so much inside your inside cannot be <unk>
So I talked about a conference a couple months later.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> Research <unk> who have a technology that allows them to project light on any surface, and then with a laser pointer that's about that and record negative space.
So they go around making art facilities like this.
All the things that they <unk> they say, they're part of a life cycle.
They first start with sexual organs, then with the bad words, after the <unk> and in the end, people start to do art.
But there was always a life cycle in his <unk>
And so the journey.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of organization and so much moving the stuff on one side, we had a couple of things.
One, we touch the gates of business companies and we got a machine to <unk> it could give us a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, it's about the most <unk> I call it <unk> because when I talk to the guy you get an email from him, and you say, "I don't know it -- this guy is <unk>
The other thing we did was bring seven programmers from all over the <unk> world from all of the corners of the <unk> to our home.
My wife, the children and I, we moved to the garage in the back and these hackers and the programmers and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> took control of the house.
A lot of our friends thought that we did something totally stupid -- and that when they <unk> it would have taken the frames off the walls and then they would have <unk>
But for two weeks, we went to the <unk> <unk> my child was part of my dog, and we created this.
It's called <unk> and so you can see the <unk>
They are a couple of <unk> sunlight that we bought on the <unk> of <unk> Beach, some copper wire and <unk> stuff and Radio <unk>
We took a camera <unk> the <unk> we put it on an LED light, and now there's a device that is free -- and it builds yourself, we published the malicious code, the software is <unk>
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There is no company that says "No."
There's no hospital I can say "No."
Any person with paralysis today has access to drawing and communicate using just their eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
So at the end of the two weeks, we come back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture because this is the room of another person, and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the great opening.
And after a year of planning -- two weeks of programming moments of the entire night, Tony came back to drawing for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of his life and looking through the support system.
We ran the bed for you to see it.
And we put a projector on a wall of the parking lot of the hospital.
And he went back to draw for the first time in front of his family and friends and you can imagine, what was the feeling in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to bust out in the parking lot, so we felt like we were <unk> the graffiti as well.
At the end of this he sent us an email and this was what he said, "This was the first time he drew in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water and someone finally came to <unk> and they would get me out there for me to get me out there so that I could <unk>
It's not <unk>
And in some form that's our cry.
That's what keeps us in motion.
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a cool device, but it's the equivalent of a <unk> <unk>
Someone with this artistic potential deserves a lot more.
So we're trying to figure out how to <unk> and make it faster and robust.
Since then we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've got lots of awards.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us are making money with this.
It all comes out of our own pockets.
The awards were like, "Oh, this is <unk>
Armstrong <unk> something about us, and then in December, Time magazine were recognized as one of the 50 best inventions of 2010, and it was really cool.
The best thing about this -- and this is what ends up at the <unk> is that in April of this year in the <unk> of the <unk> in the center of Los Angeles is going to be an exhibition called <unk> in the <unk>
And <unk> in <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of urban art.
<unk> is going to be in the show which is pretty impressive.
So basically this is my idea: if you see something that is not possible, do it happen.
Nothing in this room was possible -- the stage, the computer, the <unk> -- nothing was possible at a certain moment.
Make it <unk> anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with the recognition technology -- I just recognized something and <unk> me with wonderful people to be able to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want you all to do every day when we find something that we feel that you have to do. If it's not right now, it will be done. And if I'm not a me."
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years <unk> in situations usually very difficult and at the same time a lot of dangerous.
I went to the hard <unk>
I worked in a <unk> mine.
<unk> in <unk> and dangerous <unk>
And I spent 30 days -- eating only this -- fun in the beginning, something hard in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in a lot of my career I've been <unk> in situations in horrifying situations with the only goal to treat.
So when I knew I would come here to make a TEDTalk on the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little different.
So some of you may have heard it or not, a couple of weeks ago, I took an <unk> on <unk>
I sent a few messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I offered them to sell the rights of the name of my TEDTalk in 2011.
What was the following: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk that you have no idea what it is and on the content I could do it in the face, especially if I put it in ridiculous to you or your company doing it.
But said this, it's a very good opportunity to <unk>
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a degree in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew somebody was going to buy the rights of the name.
If I had asked him a year ago I couldn't have been able to do with certainty.
But in the new film that I'm working on, we looked at the <unk> world.
And as I said earlier, I've gotten myself in horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could <unk> I could do it for something so hard or so dangerous to go into the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan <unk> I want to do a film that is about <unk> of products, the marketing and the advertising, and that the whole film was <unk> with <unk> of marketing and <unk>
The film is going to call "The largest film ever <unk>
What happens in "The largest <unk> film, is that everything up at the bottom at the end, has images of brand, all the time from the <unk> that appears before the title of the title of the title of the <unk>
Now this brand <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people were <unk> by the film to <unk> for forever.
And so the film explores all this idea, <unk> <unk> is <unk> Is it <unk> It's <unk> It's <unk> It's <unk>
I'm a <unk>
It was <unk> It was <unk>
But we are not just going to have the mark of the mark X in the title but that we're going to make sure we use all the categories that we could in the film.
You may have a shoe and becomes the most great shoe that you've ever met.
The most great car that you have driven in "The greatest film, the best drink that you would have <unk> <unk> from "The greatest movie ever <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is so besides showing the brands as part of the life, make them <unk> the <unk> <unk> Doing the <unk> MS: And we actually show the whole process of how it works.
The <unk> goal is transparency.
You're going to see the whole process in this movie.
That is the full idea, everything shot by beginning to end.
And I would love to help you help make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear that; it's the maximum respect for the audience.
<unk> However, I don't know how <unk> it is going to be the people to that.
<unk> You have a <unk> -- I don't know if you're <unk> it's very <unk> but you know how it goes to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> David <unk> How much money do you need to do this?
MS: A million and a half -- <unk> Very <unk> John <unk> I think it's going to be difficult for them, but definitely it's going to be worth convincing to convince a couple of big <unk>
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the moment that the movie is going to look like a lot of <unk> <unk>
MS: What do you think is going to be the answer?
Stuart <unk> Most of the answers will be "No."
MS: But it's going to be hard for <unk> for the film or to be me?
JK:
MS: <unk> means you're not very optimistic.
So, I need help. I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right.
MK: We need to think about what to brands.
MS: Yeah. <unk> That's the <unk> When you look at the people you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places where to go, <unk> <unk> the camera.
MS: So I thought that <unk> the <unk> meant we have a conversation outside the microphone.
<unk> the camera means "We don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And it was one by one, all these companies suddenly disappeared.
None of them wanted to have nothing to do with this movie.
I was surprised.
They didn't want to know anything with this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought the concept of advertising, was present to the product as many people as possible, to make as many people look at it as possible.
Especially in the world today, this intersection of new media today and old media scenario and the scenario of the whole media scenario is not the idea to tell that new vehicle <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, that my idea had a mistake, and that mistake was this.
I didn't really have such a mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been okay.
But the problem was what this image.
See, when you look for images from <unk> on Google <unk>   This is one of the first images that were <unk>
I like your way to get Sergey <unk> No.
This was the problem: <unk> <unk> or <unk> easily detected or easily <unk> which is characterized by the visibility or access to information, especially in <unk> practices as well as the biggest line is probably the greatest problem.
You see, we heard a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> President <unk> the <unk> the <unk>
But suddenly when it comes to make it something suddenly changes suddenly.
But why? Well, transparency gives us <unk>  like that <unk> bear still <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this weird <unk>
And it's also very risky.
What else is it <unk>
<unk> a whole bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and to tell you that we wanted to tell this story and said, "No, we want you to <unk> <unk> story.
We want you to have a story, but that <unk> <unk> story."
See, when I was a kid and my father <unk> me in some lie -- and there he was looking at him as a <unk> said, "Son, there are three sides in every story.
It's your story, it's my story, and it's the <unk> story.
You see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, a agency wanting to help me -- and that just because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> of many years -- I realized that I would have to go on my mind, I would have to take the <unk> and go to the companies myself with all my team.
So what I started to see suddenly -- and I started to give me <unk> is that when you start talking to companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who make big movies make big, huge giants and others who make small, independent movies, like mine.
And my friends who make big Hollywood movies say that the reason their movies have so much success is due to the emotional brands that they have.
And then my friends who make independent movies say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant movies of <unk>
And the film is called "The largest film ever <unk>
How are we going to see specifically <unk> in the movie?
Every time I'm going to go out every time I open my <unk> you see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with someone I can say, "Are you good for this <unk>
You're ready? You see a little bit nervous.
I want to help you make you <unk>
Maybe you should get a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there is one of these <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have both for a man like to <unk> solid, <unk> <unk>
That's the overall <unk>
Now I can answer your questions and give you a <unk>
Karen Frank: We are a small brand.
<unk> the kind of smaller movies that we <unk> are rather a <unk> brand.
So we don't have the budget that has other brands.
So do things like this, you know, remind people to be the reason why we care about it.
MS: What words would you use to describe <unk>
<unk> is in white.
<unk> That's a big question.
Volunteer: <unk>
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put into the <unk>
Man: We talk about something bold <unk>
I think that <unk> is a great word that really puts in positive versus <unk> smell and <unk>
It keeps it <unk>
How do you keep us fresh, <unk> more <unk> more <unk>
Things like those that are <unk>
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What's a common guy in that?
I need to talk to the man on the street, and people like me, to the ordinary <unk>
They have to tell me about my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Man: I mean, my <unk>
I don't know.
I like good <unk>
Woman: revive the '80s, <unk> <unk> unless it is <unk>
MS: Okay, what is the <unk> <unk>
<unk> Something only <unk> <unk> <unk> I guess the kind of gender, the style that I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like a lot of dark colors, a lot of gray colors, and things like that.
They're usually wearing <unk> like sunglasses, or like <unk> and so on.
Woman: If Dan was a brand could be a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: The brand I am, like, <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: And it is partly <unk> in a <unk> part -- <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the kind of pets.
We make toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my little sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is <unk> because <unk> <unk>
Man 5: <unk> <unk> failure.
Is that something?
<unk> I'm a <unk>
<unk> I'm <unk>
MS: Well, not all of us can be <unk> but I often <unk> at the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized that I needed an expert.
I needed someone who could get into my head, someone who could help me understand what they call the <unk> <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that personality.
If they were able to do it for them, they could surely do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the pictures, right?
MS: Yeah. The first photo is a familiar photograph.
A: <unk> a little bit about how it relates to your thoughts and feelings of your way to be.
MS: These people shape my way to see the world.
A: Tell me about that world.
MS: That world? I think your world is the world in which you are going to do as the people around you, your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the work you do.
All of those things came out and start in a place and in my case, and they start in my family, in West Virginia.
A: What's the next thing you want to talk about.
MS: Next is this the best day of my life."
A: how does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like I want to be me.
I like the different things.
I like weird stuff. I like weird stuff.
A: Tell me about what does it do for this?
What is the <unk> What phase of the <unk> you find now?
Why is it important to <unk> What is <unk>
Tell me a little bit about that.
It's not who you are.
What else do you <unk>
I don't have to have to be afraid.
MS: <unk> <unk> Thank you. No, thank you.
A: thank you for your patience. <unk> Great <unk> <unk> Yes. <unk> Thank you very much.)
MS: Yes, I don't know what is going to go out of this.
I had a lot of crazy all over this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides of it, but <unk> in your personality of <unk> the brand Morgan <unk> is a <unk> brand.
It was very well placed together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think some companies are only <unk> in one of your strong strengths or the other rather than focus on both.
Lots of companies tend to avoid the things that are not <unk> to avoid fear, those elements -- and you actually give them a little positive for you, and you're nice to see that.
What other brands are this?
The first here is the <unk>
And you can also see here at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are <unk> and <unk> <unk> those things that have gone and come back, but a <unk> brand is quite powerful.
MS: <unk> <unk> What's your <unk>
If someone asked you to raise your brand identity and your brand personality and what would be?
You're a <unk> <unk> You're someone who makes blood <unk>
Or are you more a <unk> <unk>
A little bit more <unk> <unk> <unk>
The attributes of attributes that are like playful will be like <unk> contemporary contemporary or bold or bold as <unk> <unk> faster or <unk> <unk> <unk> magical or mystical as <unk>
Or are you more well from <unk> <unk>
You're <unk> sophisticated as <unk>
You're <unk> traditional <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You're <unk> stable, familiar, safe, sacred, <unk> or wise like the Dalai Lama or <unk>
In the course of this film, we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said, <unk> they didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mainly because they would have no control of control over the final product.
We allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we got to tell the story in this movie of how you use MRI to identify the desire centers in the brain as well for business as a movie for a movie.
We went to San Paulo where advertising is <unk>
In the entire city for the last five years, there is no <unk> there is no <unk> no <unk>
And we went to school districts where companies are going to be going into the schools with problems of available in the United States.
The incredible thing to me is that the projects that I have had the greatest response, or that I've had more success are the ones that I've interacted with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
They went off to the <unk> they took their agencies, and they said maybe these agencies are not having my best interest in mind.
I'm going to try directly with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to make people, which is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how do you gone? They <unk>
Well, since the film was released in the <unk> <unk> let's take a look.
By <unk> the film was released in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million impressions in the media for this film.
This covers just a period of two weeks and average.
That's only in <unk> no press, no TV.
The film is still not <unk>
It's still not online. It's not in <unk>
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has already started winning momentum.
And it's not bad, because almost all of the agencies that we talked about is giving their customers not part.
I have always believed that if you take risks, if you take risks, that in those risks there are opportunities.
I think when you get to the people that are pushing them to failure.
I think when you train their employees in the loss in risk that they are preparing all your company for <unk>
I feel that what has to happen to make progress is that we have to encourage people to <unk>
We need to encourage people to be not afraid of the opportunities that they can <unk>
Ultimately, let's go forward, I think we have to give a fear.
We need to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear <unk> the risk.
From a <unk> we have to embrace the peril.
And ultimately, we have to harbor transparency.
Today, more than some honesty is going to go along a long way.
And said this, with honesty and transparency, all my whole talk -- the <unk> has been presented by my good friends of <unk> who was for <unk> bought the rights of the name in <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data in great opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> presents <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much people.
June Cohen: So, <unk> in the name of transparency, that happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a fantastic question.
In my pocket I have a check on the TED organization, the <unk> Foundation, a check for <unk> to be applied to my support for the TED next year.
The idea behind the <unk> <unk> is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their largest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the <unk> plant.
The gray boxes that you see are systems of control in real time.
If we get to compromise these systems that control speeds and <unk> we can have a lot of problems with the <unk>
The gray boxes are not using <unk> software -- they're a completely different technology.
But if we did a cash virus of Windows in a portable computer using an engineer to set up this gray, box, so we are ready.
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with a <unk> Windows.
The <unk> entered the gray, box hurts the <unk> and the Iranian nuclear program is <unk> mission.
It's easy, yeah?
I want to tell you how we discovered this.
When we started researching <unk> six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing that you knew is that it's very, very complex in the <unk> the <unk> using multiple <unk>
It seemed to want to do something with these <unk> <unk> these control systems.
That struck us the attention, and we started an experiment where we <unk> our environment with <unk> and we saw what happened with this.
So they got very strange things.
<unk> <unk> like a lab of lab that didn't like our <unk> the wave, but I didn't want to eat.
I had no sense for me.
And after experiment with different taste of cheese, I realized, and I thought, "This is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is actively seeking in the gray box if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program that is trying to infect is actually working on that <unk>
If not, it doesn't do anything.
So that struck my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we said, "We don't know what the <unk> is.
It might be, let's say, for example, a power plant, or a chemical plant in Germany.
Better to <unk> the goal soon.
So we pulled up and <unk> the attack code, and we found that it was <unk> in two <unk> bombs and a big one.
We also saw that they were very <unk> with people that obviously had all the internal information.
Let's get all the points for which to attack.
You probably even know how much it <unk> the operator.
So you know all.
And if you've heard the <unk> of <unk> it's complex, and high technology, let me tell them, the payload is very complex.
It's very above everything we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this code of attack.
We're talking about about 15 thousand lines of code.
It looks like a lot of the old <unk> language.
I want to tell you how we could find sense of this code.
What we were looking at at the beginning were called the system, because we know what they do.
Then we were looking for <unk> and data structures and tried to deal with them with the real world, with potential potential for real world.
We need <unk> theories that we can pass or <unk>
To get to theories about goals, we remember that it's definitely a violent <unk> it must be a <unk> <unk> and it's probably sitting in Iran, because it's where most infection has been <unk>
There are no thousands of goals in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant plant, and the <unk> plant of <unk>
So I told my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and power plants between our <unk>
I called them and I brought them into an effort to <unk> their experience with what we found on code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the little digital <unk> with control of the <unk>
<unk> is that mobile part of the <unk> that black object you see.
If you run the speed of this <unk> they can certainly <unk> and even make the <unk> <unk>
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and <unk> in an obvious effort to go crazy to the nest engineers so that they couldn't solve this quickly.
We try to figure out the big digital <unk> by looking very close to the data and the structures.
So for example, the number <unk> stands up on that code, you can't afford it.
I started looking at scientific literature about how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they're <unk> in what is called a <unk> and every waterfall has <unk> <unk>
That made sense, there was a coincidence.
And it got better yet.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called <unk>
And guess what we found in <unk> code.
A almost <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of trust to understand what we had between hands.
And so it wasn't <unk> it wasn't like this.
The results have been off after several weeks of hard work.
<unk> <unk> dead dead ends.
Yet, we found that both digital <unk> would say to a single single goal, but from different perspectives.
The little <unk> is taking a <unk> and doing <unk> and <unk> and the big <unk> communicates with six <unk> and manipulating <unk>
In <unk> we're very confident that we've determined what the <unk> is.
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We don't have to worry about other goals that are <unk> by <unk>
So here I show you some very interesting things that I just saw -- I really <unk>
There's the gray, box and up you see the <unk>
What this thing does is intercept the input values of the sensors for example, of the sensors and the sensors on vibration and provide code, which is still running during the attack, with fake data <unk>
And believe it or not, these fake input data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like the Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera is fed with video video.
Is it great <unk>
The idea here is obviously not only <unk> in the <unk>
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security system.
We need digital safety systems where a human operator could not act fast.
For example, in a energy plant, when the great steam turbine is going on speed -- you have to open away tubes in a <unk>
Obviously, this cannot do it a human operator, right?
That's where we need digital security.
And when they're <unk> then you can spend bad things.
The plant can exploit.
And not the <unk> or the security system is <unk>
That scares you.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
It has nothing to see, specifically with <unk> <unk>
It could work as well, for example, in a power plant, or a <unk>
It's <unk>
And you don't have <unk> <unk> that disseminate this payload with a <unk> key as we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use conventional technology of worms.
<unk> as possible.
And if you made that, with what you have to do is with a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence that we need to face.
Unfortunately, the largest number of goals for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and in Japan.
All the green areas are spaces with large numbers of goals.
We have to deal with the implications, and better that we start to prepare today.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has taken public in many sides that people assume that <unk> is the main place behind this.
What's your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, really want to hear this?
Yeah. <unk>
My guess is that the <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the <unk> superpower, of this.
There's one alone, and that's the United States, hopefully <unk>
Because, otherwise our problems would be even older.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
I want you to imagine a robot that can take you and give them <unk> skills or another one that makes chairs of the wheels get up and come back to walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
It's not different than something that gets in the morning, gives you a big force, which is also increasing your speed, and it aid, for example, to manage the balance.
It's actually the real integration of man and the machine.
But not only that -- it can integrate it and connect it with the universe and with other <unk> things.
This is not a <unk> idea.
So to show you now what we're working on, we started talking about the American soldier who, on average, must take over their back a <unk> burden and it's <unk> getting even more equipment.
Obviously, this leads to some important complications in injury in 30 percent of the soldiers -- with <unk> <unk>
So we decided to look at this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help manage the matter.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> -- or <unk> <unk> <unk>
Soldier: With the <unk> exoskeleton I can get 50 pounds of variables for a lot of hours.
Their flexible design, it allows you to put in <unk> <unk> and running movements with great <unk>
I want to do what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it increases my strength and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device, this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
Let's go back to the <unk> of chairs with the same thing that I feel particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people roughly, in the wheelchair, all over the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is really conservative.
We talk about something that happens very often, very young people with damage to the column that when they start their life -- to the 20, 30 or 40 years -- collide against a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be their only option.
We also talk about the population that is <unk> quickly.
His only option, a lot of times -- by a brain injury or some <unk> <unk>
And this has been so much over the last 500 years, from its successful <unk> as I have to recognize.
So we decided to start by writing a new chapter on mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who do 19 years ago, he had a <unk> column, and as a result couldn't go back for 19 years, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> that <unk>
It's got sensors on it.
It's completely not <unk> in the crutches that send cues to the computer on board, here on the back.
There are also some batteries that give the motors to the motors in the <unk> and they make them move through this soft and very natural <unk>
AB: I was 24 years on the top of my life when I was a stranger jump in the air, skiing up on the bottom <unk>
In a fraction of a second, I lost all feeling and all movement <unk>
Shortly later, a doctor went into my room in the hospital, and he said, <unk> you never will go to <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
So I stole the last hint of hope of my being.
<unk> technology since then, has allowed me to learn to <unk> it costs down in <unk> climbing rocks and even riding a <unk>
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, until now.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms to sit and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change the life of future generations -- not just by soldiers, but by Amanda, and all the users of chairs with all the same chairs of the wheels, to everyone.
AB: Thank you.
I just came back from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> practice sex to say hello, and play is the order of the day -- where fun is serious.
And no, it's not the <unk> Man festival.
Ladies and gentlemen, you know their cousins.
This is the world of the wild bonobos of rainforests in rainforests in Congo.
The bonobos are, along with the chimpanzees, their closest living relatives.
That means that we all share a common ancestor -- an evolutionary <unk> that lived about six million years ago.
Now, the chimpanzees are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've done too much emphasis on this aspect of our narratives of human evolution.
But the bonobos will tell us the other side of the coin.
Whereas the chimpanzees are dominated by big <unk> <unk> the Bonobo society is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created a special thing, because this leads to a very tolerant society where the deadly violence is still not <unk>
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least <unk> of the great apes.
They live in the depths of the forest <unk> and it's been very difficult to <unk>
The Congo is a <unk> a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the <unk> <unk> stage of a violent conflict that has been done for decades and caused almost as many deaths as the First World War.
It's no wonder that this destruction is also going to be <unk> survival of the Bonobo.
<unk> beef and deforestation, make it can't fill in a stadium with the bonobos that stay in the world -- and honestly, we are not sure.
However, in this land of violence and chaos you can hear the wild laughter <unk> the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know them as the ape <unk> love, not the <unk> because they have <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> to manage conflict and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of the Bonobos is more than <unk> <unk>
<unk> like humans, like humans, they love to play throughout their lifetime.
Play is not just a children's game.
For us, and for them, the game is fundamental to establish bonds and foster <unk>
With him we learn to <unk> and learn the <unk>
The game increases creativity and resilience and it has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity of behaviors, of connections.
And when you look at the <unk> <unk> you see the root roots themselves, the dance, the dance, and the human ritual,
The game is the glue that brings us together.
I don't know how to play it, but I want to show you a couple of only <unk> videos from the wild.
First, it's a <unk> game, and I'm not talking about football.
Here we have a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look at what's doing it.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase, "You've got a <unk>
I just believe that in this case he liked it, right?
Yes.
So sexual play is both in bonobos like humans.
And this video is really interesting because we <unk> this video really is interesting because it shows the invention of bringing elements in unusual elements to play -- like <unk> and also how play requires trust, and <unk> and the <unk> and at the same time is the most fun.
But the game is <unk>
So the game is <unk> it can adopt a lot of ways, some of which are more <unk> <unk> <unk> perhaps the place where the wonder.
And I want you to <unk> this is <unk> a young female who is playing with <unk>
I think, like that, sometimes we played ourselves, and we explore the limits of our inner worlds and outside.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to go back to interact. And then the unexpected connections that we form are the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just little samples from the understanding that the Bonobo gives us from our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future that we have to adapt to a world more and harder and greater creativity and more cooperation.
The secret is that play is the key of these abilities.
In other words, play is our <unk> <unk>
To adapt to a success to a world that changes we need to play.
But let's bring it to the maximum <unk>
The game is not <unk>
The game is critical.
For <unk> and humans, the life is not only cruel and <unk>
When it seems like the least appropriate thing to play, you can be the moments that it is more <unk>
So for that, partners accept this gift of evolution and play together while <unk> creativity, friendship and wonder.
Thank you.
New York City is responsible for development of a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not battling poverty, <unk> fires as a captain <unk> in a <unk> body.
And in our city, where the volunteers caused a highly <unk> <unk> you have to get to the fire site very soon to get into action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so I had a pretty high probability of going.
But there was still a career on the other volunteers to get the captain in charge and figure out what it was for our task.
When I found the <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the <unk> that I certainly went through one of the worst days of his life.
We were at full night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> on your pajamas and his house was on fire.
The other volunteer that I had just gotten before me before me, <unk> <unk> <unk> came up with the captain and he asked him to put up and save the dog <unk>
The <unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or <unk> for the rest of his life, I would have to tell the people who walked into a burning building to save a live being alive just because I won it for five seconds.
Well, I was the next.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need to be at the house.
I need you to <unk> <unk> the fire, and let this woman get a pair of shoes."
I promise I <unk>
It wasn't exactly what I expected but <unk> I went on the stairs, at the end of the hall, I went to the firemen <unk> that at that height or less ended up to turn off the fire and hit the fourth main room for a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my payload around the ladder where I met my <unk> and the lovely dog at the front door.
I got rid of the house treasures that I <unk> as it was for expected, his treasure trove of attention than mine.
A few weeks later, the department received a letter from the <unk> house for the brave effort demonstrated to save her home.
The kindness that she watched for the other was that someone had reached a pair of shoes.
Both of my calling in Robin <unk> as in my calling as in my calling as the volunteer fireman I am witness to the acts of generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also of <unk> <unk>
And you know what I've learned?
Everything has its importance.
So when I look at this room to people who have succeeded, or they are going to do -- remarkable levels of success I would like to remind you this: <unk>
Don't wait to win the first million to make the difference in somebody's life.
If you have a little bit of giving, you get it now.
<unk> food in a dining room, <unk> a neighborhood.
They're mentors.
Not every day.
So he trained the <unk> <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, you come back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I'm a big fan of the concrete <unk>
The first concrete block is made in <unk> with a very simple idea, of concrete as a fixed measure that they fit together.
Very quickly, these became the most used construction unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build bigger things than us, like buildings or bridges -- a brick at once.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, to <unk> it came up with this.
He was called <unk>
And in a few years, the brick of <unk> came to all the home.
It's estimated that they've made over 400 billion or 75 bricks for each person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build bridges -- buildings or homes.
<unk> made it accessible.
<unk> simply took the record block, the favorite of the world, and it turned it into a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the Bell labs, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new building block.
The transistor was a little plastic unit that would take us from a world of <unk> <unk> piled on one other to a world where everything was interactive.
Just like the concrete block, the transistor enables it to make a lot more and more complex, a brick at once.
But there's a <unk> difference -- the transistor was just for experts.
I personally didn't think that the building blocks blocks of our time are <unk> so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I started exploring the idea of the engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started developing <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronic modules each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, and sensors.
And the best thing about everything is that they connect with magnets.
So you can't put it in the wrong way.
The bricks have a color code.
The green is the <unk> the blue is the stream, the pink is the input and the orange color.
So you only have to assemble a blue with a green one, and very quickly you can start to make older area.
A blue one with a green one, make light.
We can put a button in the middle and we have a <unk>
If we change the button by a <unk> module.
We get this <unk> to create more impact and we have a sound machine.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are actually very powerful.
Instead of having that program, connecting and <unk> <unk> allows us to program using very simple <unk>
To make <unk> faster or slower, just this button that makes the pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's a collection growth.
We want all of the interactions in the world to go into brick bricks and use.
<unk> sounds, solar panels, <unk> everything must be accessible.
We've given the kids to watch them play with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best thing is how they start to understand the electronics of every day that you don't learn in schools.
For example, how it works a light at night, or why the door of an elevator is still open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We have also taken <unk> to design schools.
So for example, designers with no experience in electronics start playing with <unk> like a material.
You can see, with paper bottles and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>  A few weeks ago, we took <unk> to the School of Rhode Island School who have no expertise in engineering, only in the wood and paper, and we said, Make something.
Here's an example of a project that has done, an <unk> <unk> <unk>
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> made of dough that is afraid of the darkness.
For these not engineers, <unk> became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to do all of us.
So <unk> has open code.
You can visit the website, you can download all the design files and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world in which we live, this interactive world, is ours.
So let's go ahead and make things.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you today about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology.
And my little company seeks to get involved with the environment focused on the <unk>
<unk> collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
<unk> Wait a moment.
You can take a little bit of <unk>
<unk> we can continue to better leave the video on one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
Technology is ...
Oh, I was like, <unk>
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago, I launched an initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything we're supposed to do, and we asked them to work on the government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and it would be like <unk> Peace <unk>
So let's put some members every year and put them together with the <unk>
Instead of sending them to the Third World and send them the wild world to <unk>
They made great <unk> worked with the <unk>
Your task is to show the possibilities of today's technology.
<unk> <unk>
It's a <unk> in the city of Boston.
Here it appears as if I would find a quote, but what it really looks for is that somebody is going to clean up when it is caught up on the snow because it knows it's not very good at turning fires when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did they come to ask for the help of this so <unk>
Last year in Boston, we had a team of members of <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February and at that moment, they were very <unk> last year.
They realized that the city never wiped these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> noticed something else -- that citizens who are <unk> with <unk> the sidewalks right in front of them.
So he did like any good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice app that you can take a <unk>
You keep <unk> when you <unk>
When I did that, you put a name, in this case, he put it <unk>
If you don't do it, someone can <unk>
I mean, it has a <unk>
It's a modest box.
Maybe it's the tiniest <unk> applications last year.
But it does something that no other technology of the Afghan government.
It spreads <unk>
A responsible for <unk> systems of <unk> to see this app realized that it could use it, not for the snow, but for citizens to make <unk>
It's very important to work these <unk> in the tsunami, but people were <unk>
So it asks the citizens to <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make citizens <unk> the <unk> <unk>
And Chicago just <unk> to make people clean up to clean sidewalks when they <unk>
So now we know about nine cities that we can use using it.
And this has been spread without <unk> in a natural and natural manner.
If you know a little government technology, you know this doesn't normally happen.
<unk> software usually takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston, we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool so that parents could choose the best public school for their children.
Then we told us that I had done by the normal channels it would have taken at least two years and cost about two million dollars.
And that's not nothing.
Now there's a project in the California court of California that until the time has over 2,000 dollars and doesn't work.
And there are projects like this at every level of government.
So an app that shows up in a couple of days, and it spreads in a viral way, is a luck of warning to the institution of the government.
It suggests the best of the best ways to work, not as in private enterprises, like a lot of people think it should be.
Not as a technological company, but rather like the Internet itself.
I mean, without <unk> in a open and <unk> way.
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents the way to address the question of government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of an institution, but as a problem of collective action.
And that's really good because it turns out that we're very good for collective action with digital technology.
And there's a very large community of people who are building the tools for us to connect together with efficacy.
And it's not only <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people all over the country that contribute <unk> applications every day in their own communities.
You haven't given up with the government.
Do you feel a great frustration of that, but they don't get the <unk>
And these people know something that we have lost in sight.
And that is that if we leave the feelings of the politics, the line in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all those other things that make us crazy -- the government is, essentially, in the words of Tim <unk> "What we do together because we alone didn't exist.
Now, a lot of people have abandoned the government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to do it, because things are changing.
Politics is not <unk> the government itself.
And because the government ultimately <unk> we -- remember that of the <unk> the <unk> the way it will affect the way to produce change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought that government was to choose people to make them <unk>
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is mostly about <unk>
This is the center of the telephone and information center.
It's the place that the calls is called if you have a <unk> brand in the United States.
Scott <unk> This call.
He joined <unk> in official knowledge.
I didn't find any. It started with animal control.
And finally he said, "Hey, you can open the gates of the house, put music very hard and see if you <unk>
And it worked. So for Scott.
But that wasn't the end of the <unk>
Boston has not a call center.
It has a <unk> and mobile application, called <unk> <unk>
You didn't get that application.
It was the work of very clever people from the Bureau of New York City <unk>
One day, this actually happened, this <unk> <unk> in my bucket -- I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do to <unk>
The <unk> dynamic <unk> is different.
Scott was talking to person.
In <unk> <unk> everything is public, so everyone can see this.
In this case, he saw it a neighbor.
The next report said, "I went up to the place, found the bucket behind the house.
<unk> Yes. <unk> Yes.
I turned the <unk> I went home.
Good nights, sweet <unk>
Quite simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of digital and physical <unk>
And it's also a great example of the income of government to collaboration voluntary voluntary collaboration.
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the definition of technological platform.
I'm talking about a platform for people to <unk> and help others.
So, a citizen helped another one but here the government had a key role.
I connected the two people.
And I could have them connected with government services that we need to do but neighbor is a better and cheaper alternative than the government services.
When a neighbor helps each other, <unk> the communities.
If we call the animals, that costs a lot of money.
One important thing that we need to think about government is that it's not the same thing that politics.
A lot of people do it, but think that one is the input of the other.
That our input to the government system is a vote.
How many times have you chosen an political leader, sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader, and then we hope that the government <unk> our values and the <unk> our needs but then we don't see change.
That is because government is like an immense ocean and politics is <unk> <unk> <unk>
So below it is what we call <unk>
And we say that word <unk>
But it is that <unk> which holds us that in which we have to create as something that is operating against us, that else, and in a result, we're losing power.
People believe that politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work that we will have to make the bureaucracy is sexy.
Because this is where the real work is happening.
We have to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the <unk> movement.
They're <unk>
It's a group of citizens who have written a very detailed report for 325 pages in response to the request of the <unk> <unk> <unk> on the financial reform project.
That's not political activism -- it's activism.
And for the ones that we have <unk> to government, is time to ask us what world we want to leave our children.
You have to see the enormous challenges that they will have to face.
They really believe that we will get to where we have to go without the institution that can act on behalf of <unk>
We can't leave government, we need it to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to rethink the root function so that it can expand <unk> to civil society.
There is a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not that hard to act <unk> you just have to articulate the right <unk> systems.
The average age of our members is 28 years old, so I am a generation of older than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up by taking the word and giving it almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who is going to <unk> everybody will talk.
They can express your opinions in any channel at the same time and do it.
So when the government deal with the government doesn't matter so much to make your voices.
They're using your hands.
They bring the work to the work to program applications that make better work to the government.
And those applications allow us to use the hands to improve our communities.
It may be cleaning up a <unk> by taking away <unk> <unk> a garbage cube that has a <unk> inside.
Of course, we could always have cleaned up those <unk> and a lot of people do it.
But these applications are like digital <unk> that we're not only consumers, but we're not only consumers of government that we pay taxes and we get services.
We are more than that. We're citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until you don't get the <unk>
So I want to ask everybody, when it comes to the important things that we have to do together, we will be a crowd of voices, or we will also be a crowd of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in prisons, prisons and the death row.
I've spent most of my life in <unk> communities in projects and places where there's a lot of despair.
And being here at TED watching and hearing these <unk> has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things that I noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that tell you here have impact around the world.
On occasion, if something comes from TED, it makes a sense and a force that would have no other way.
I say this because I think identity is important.
Here we've seen fantastic presentations here.
And I think that we have learned that the words of a professor can make a lot of sense, but if they teach them with feeling, they can have a special meaning of it.
A doctor can do good things, <unk> if it's <unk> it can do much more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't really learn this in the practice of the law, my job.
I learned about my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house of a <unk> family, dominated by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was tough it was strong, and it was power.
It was the last word in the whole discussion in the family.
She <unk> a lot of the <unk> in our home.
It was daughter of people who had been slaves.
His parents were born in slavery in Virginia <unk>
She was born on the <unk> and his experience with slavery <unk> the way I saw the world.
She was hard, but it was also <unk>
When I was a little bit and looked at him, she was approaching me and gave me a good <unk>
I was so hard that I could barely breathe and then <unk>
One or two hours later, I went back to <unk> I was approaching me and said, <unk> you still feel my <unk>
And if I said no, I would tell me it again and if I said yes, I was left peace.
I had this human quality that I would always wish to be close to it.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the lowest of 10.
At occasion, when I was going to spend a time with it, it wasn't easy to capture his time and attention.
My cousins were running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight or nine years, I woke up one morning, I went to the room and were running all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me.
I thought it was a game.
And then I looked at it, and she was <unk> but she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she stood across the room, I took my hand out of my hand, and he said, "Come on. Two are we going to <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I will never forget it.
It took me outside and said, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't tell you <unk>
I said, "Okay, <unk>
She said, "Now <unk> <unk> I said, "Sure."
Then I sat down, I looked at me and said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> that you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you want.
I will never forget it.
Then he said, "Just want me to get three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "What first I want you to do is you always want your mother."
<unk> "She is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that always <unk>
As I <unk> my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> so I <unk>
Then he said to me, "The second I want you to get excited about is that you will always do the right thing even though the right thing is <unk>
I thought about it, and I said, "Yes, <unk> So <unk>
And then finally he said, "The third thing I want you to tell me is that you never get <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
I grew up in the field, in Southern <unk> I have a brother a year older and a younger child.
When I was 14 or 15, one day my brother came home with a <unk> <unk> I don't know where the <unk> took me to my sister and I went to the forest.
We just have the <unk>
He took a sip of beer, she offered my sister, she took a little bit and offered me to me.
I said, "No, no, no. Okay. You know, but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, <unk> <unk> And you always do the same thing as we do.
I took something, your sister <unk> <unk> <unk>
I said, "No. I wouldn't feel good. You can <unk>
Then my brother looked straight at me.
He said, "What's up? Take a <unk>
I took the look with the strength and <unk> "Oh, not that you're thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells you all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that probably shouldn't say.
I know that this is <unk>
But I have 52 years and I can admit that I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I don't say this is a <unk> I mean by the power of identity.
When we create the right type of identity, we say things to others that really do not make sense.
We cannot get them to do things that don't believe to do.
I think my grandmother's naturally believed that all his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been a prisoner for <unk>
My <unk> died of age-related <unk>
And these were the things that, according to it, we should <unk>
Now, try to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is very different today than it was 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
Today there is 2.3 million.
In the United States we have the largest incarceration rate in the world.
We have seven million people in parole.
And this mass <unk> in my opinion, has completely changed our world.
In poor communities or black communities, it's so much <unk> so often, determined by these facts.
One of the three black men between the 18 and 30 years is in jail or parole.
In urban <unk> across the country, Los Angeles, <unk> Baltimore Washington, Washington from 50 to 60 percent of all young women are in jail or parole.
Our system is not just distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a judicial system that makes you much better if you're rich and <unk> that if you're poor and innocent.
It's not <unk> but wealth is the results that <unk> the results.
And it seems to be very <unk>
The fear of fear and anger make us believe that these are not ours.
We are <unk>
I find it interesting.
We're looking at our work some more curious.
In my state, in Alabama, as well as in other states, you care about rights, if you have a criminal <unk>
Right now, the <unk> of the black population population has lost the right to the vote.
And if we put it over the next 10 years, the loss of loss of loss to be as high as it was before the law of the right to vote.
We have this amazing silence.
I represent children.
Many of my clients are very young.
The United States is the only country in the world that is sentence to 13 years old in prison.
We have in this country prison for kids, without a chance to come out.
Right now, we are in a process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
<unk> people in death row.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
And in a certain sense, they have been told to think that the final question is, people deserve to die for the <unk> <unk>
Very sensitive question.
But you can think about another way of how we are in our identity.
There's another way of <unk> it's not about deciding if people deserve to die for <unk> crimes -- but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
The death sentence in America is defined by mistake.
Out of every nine <unk> people have identified which is <unk> which is <unk> and released from the death row.
A <unk> mistake, <unk> an innocent of every nine.
This is interesting.
<unk> would not be allowed to be able to be able to fly airplanes if in every nine that they would have to be <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our struggle.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue if we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students about <unk> <unk> I talk about slavery with me.
I talk about terrorism, the time that started at the end of the rebuilding and that lasted until the Second World War.
We really don't know a lot about this.
But for American Americans in this country, it was a little bit defined by terror.
In many communities people were afraid of being <unk>
They were worried to be <unk>
The threat of terror was what defined his lives.
Now there are older people who come to me and say, "Mr. Stevenson, you teaches talks, does <unk> <unk> people who stop saying that in our history we deal with the first time with the first time with terrorism, after <unk>
They ask me to say, "No, <unk> that we grew with that."
The age of terrorism went on, obviously, with segregation and decades of production, racial and <unk>
In this country we have a dynamic that we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've historically done.
All of the time <unk> each other.
We create tensions and conflict.
It costs us work to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a real truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that you could not overcome <unk> race without a compromise and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany to talk about death <unk>
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stopped after my presentation and said, "Do you know that it's good disturbing to listen to what you want.
<unk> "We don't have death <unk> in Germany.
<unk> will never be able to stand here."
The room was quiet and a lady said, "There's no way that with our history, we can ever get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational that we are <unk> and <unk> and <unk> we could put a <unk>
Tell me about this.
How would we feel like a world where a nation like Germany, <unk> people, especially if they were largely <unk>
We couldn't afford it.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there is this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If we don't really care about these difficult issues, the positive and wonderful things are, though, <unk>
We love innovation.
We are fascinated by technology.
We love entertainment.
But lately, those realities are <unk> by suffering, abuse, <unk> <unk>
In my opinion, we need to integrate both things.
I've talked about the need to have more hope, more commitment, more engagement, more dedication with the basic challenges of life in this complex world.
I think that means spending more time thinking and talking about the poor, the ones that will never come to TED.
And thinking about them is, in a way, something that is within our being.
We really have to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
So we are, despite being so rational, so committed to the intellectual <unk>
And the development of innovation, with creativity -- development is not only about brain ideas.
These things come from <unk> ideas, also by the heart.
This connection of the mind with the heart is what drives us to look at not just the bright and <unk> but also in the dark and the hard.
<unk> <unk> the great <unk> leader talked about this.
He said, "When we were in Eastern Europe suffering from <unk> we wanted all kinds of things, but mostly what we needed was hope, guidance for the spirit, a will for being in places that will be <unk> and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is pretty much in the heart of what I think that even in communities like TED, must be <unk>
There's no disconnect related to technology and design, that allowed us to be truly human, if we don't pay attention to poverty, to <unk> to inequality, by injustice.
Now I want to tell you that these thoughts make a much more challenging identity than if we are ignoring these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege, being a very young lawyer to meet Rosa <unk>
These women were together simply to talk about.
Occasionally, the <unk> lady called me to go, <unk> comes the <unk> <unk> We're going to get together to speak.
Do you want to come and <unk>
I would say, "I think I do."
So she said, "Well what are you going to do when you <unk>
I read <unk>
So I was going and just the <unk>
It was very <unk> very <unk>
And on one occasion I was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple hours, Ms. Parks came to me and said, "Now, you know, let me tell me that this idea of <unk> justice.
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started giving my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been <unk>
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in the management of criminal justice.
We try to end up with the sentences of life, without freedom.
We try to do something about death.
We try to reduce the population in prison.
We try to end the <unk> <unk>
I gave it all my best speech, and I was looking at me and said, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> <unk> very <unk>
At that time, Mrs. <unk> <unk> got my finger on the face and said, "It's why you have to be very but very <unk>
I think that actually the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We need to find the way to address those challenges, those problems, that suffering.
Because eventually humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been educated in simple things.
I've come to understand and believe that each one of us is higher than the worst thing we have to do.
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lie, not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if someone takes something that doesn't belong to you, it's not a <unk>
Even if someone kills each other, it's not a <unk>
So I think there's a basic dignity in the people who must be <unk> by the law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not the wealth.
So it isn't.
I really think that in many parts the opposite of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think it's very <unk> very beautiful, very <unk> very <unk> we don't judge for our technology, for our designs, or for our designs, or rational.
At the end of the end, the character of a society, not the way as the richest and <unk> and <unk> but because of the way they treat the poor, the <unk> <unk>
Because it's in this context as we start to understand really profound issues about what we are.
I sometimes feel <unk> I'm going to finish with a story.
Sometimes I do too much force.
<unk> tired, like everyone.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in an important way.
I've been representing these guys who have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to jail and I see my clients of 13 and 14 years old, who have been <unk> for them as adults as adults.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge turn someone into what is not it?
The judge was <unk> as an adult, but I see a child.
A very late night I was up <unk> for God, if the judge can turn you into something that you don't are, must have magic powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magic powers.
You should ask for something of that.
As I was very late, I couldn't think correctly, but I started working on a <unk>
I had a 14 year-old customer -- a little black <unk>
I started working on the <unk> with a <unk> who said, <unk> so that my 14-year-old white <unk> is treated like a <unk> <unk> executive <unk> of a <unk>
In the <unk> I found there was a <unk> conduct in the <unk> in the behavior of the police and in the process.
There was a <unk> line on how in this country there is no ethics, but a whole lack of ethics.
The next morning, I woke up thinking that <unk> <unk> would be a dream or really <unk>
For my horror, not only had it <unk> it had sent it to court.
It took about two months, I had forgotten it.
And finally <unk> Oh my God, I have to go to the court for this case, stupid.
I got into the car and I was really feeling <unk> <unk>
I was in the car to the court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally went down the car. He went to court.
I was going up the stairs when I met with a <unk> black man was the <unk> of the court.
When I saw me, he came to me and said, "Who is you?"
And I said, "I'm a <unk> he says, "It's <unk> <unk> I said yes.
So I approached it, and I was <unk>
And I focus on the ear, <unk>
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
That kind of connected deeply into my interior, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went into the audiences.
When I inside, the judge was seen me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this bold <unk>
And I said, "Yes, Mr. <unk> I said, and we started going.
People started to get there. They were all <unk>
I was the one that had written those <unk>
The cops came up with the <unk> the <unk> <unk>
Suddenly, not knowing how, the room was full of people, and all <unk> because we're talking about races, because we talked about poverty, because we talked about inequality.
With the <unk> of the eye, I had to see the <unk> that I was and <unk>
Look at the window and <unk> to hear all that <unk>
<unk> walking over here and so on.
Finally, this old black, with the face of concern, I walked into the room and sat behind me, almost on the lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, the judge is <unk> a <unk>
During the <unk> a <unk> <unk> was upset because the <unk> had entered the room.
The assistant over the old black <unk>
And he said, <unk> what do you do in the <unk> hall.
And the old black man stood up, looked at me and looked at me and said, <unk> this room of audiences to tell this young man to keep his view in the goal with <unk>
I have come to TED today, because I think many of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very big, but it folds toward justice.
We cannot be truly human, if we don't care about human rights, and for dignity.
That our survival is connected to each other.
That our technology, design, entertainment and creativity must be <unk> to the <unk> of <unk> and justice.
And above all, those of the people here who share this, I just want to tell you to keep your view in the goal with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: <unk> you heard and see an obvious desire for the audience, from this community, to help in your case, to do something.
One is not a check. What can we do?
<unk> There are several opportunities nearby.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which you're going to do an effort for <unk> the funds that you spend today at a policy of punishment.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars in the death row, over the next five years.
And despite this, the <unk> of the murder cases was not <unk> in <unk>
The <unk> of <unk> don't get at all.
Here's a chance of change.
This <unk> is going to come up with these funds to make it <unk> to safety.
I think there's a very close opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge decline in <unk> in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, it says that it has to do with the highest rate of <unk>
What would you say to you who believe it is this?
<unk> Actually, the rate of <unk> with violence has remained relatively stable.
The big growth in massive <unk> in this country is not for crimes with violence.
It's about the wrong <unk> war.
That's why this is dramatic increase in the <unk> population.
And we let us convince ourselves the rhetoric of punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people to the <unk> supply for stealing a bicycle, per crimes against the property, instead of making them <unk> those resources to their victims.
I think we have to do more to help victims victims and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy of punishment does not do anything for anyone.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> have you excited about this right here today.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you so much for having come to TED. Thank you.
Announcer: <unk> threats for Bin Laden.

Several <unk> War, the <unk> mass mass destruction.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Syria.
<unk> Death <unk>
Oh my God.
Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips that I got in the last six months, <unk> could be in the last six days or over the last six years.
The idea is that the media is that the press is rather <unk> because our minds pay attention to them.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of each day our senses get so much more data than the brain probably can be <unk>
And as nothing matters more than survival, the first stop that data is an ancient fragment of the temporal lobe called <unk>
The amygdala is our early warning detector, the <unk> <unk>
<unk> and record the whole information looking for something in the environment that could cause us.
So by a <unk> of <unk> stories look at the <unk>
That old adage saying, "If there's blood -- <unk> is very true.
And because all digital devices give us a negative news seven days of the week, 24 hours a day, it is not surprising to be <unk>
It's not surprising that people think the world is going to be wrong with worse.
But maybe it's not like this.
Maybe, instead, what happens is that we get <unk>
Perhaps the enormous progress done in the last century for a series of forces is <unk> so that we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems: climate change, the <unk> <unk> water <unk> and <unk> we have no doubts we have.
As human beings are very good at <unk> the problems and the long, we just got them.
<unk> then what happened in the last century to see where we go.
Over the last hundred years, the average of life has been more than <unk> the average income per capita is driven by inflation around the world.
Child mortality has reduced 10 times.
In addition, the cost of food, of electricity and communications has fallen from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we are living the most peaceful thing in human history.
And Charles <unk> that the global literacy went from 25 to more than 80 percent over the last 130 years.
We're really living at a remarkable time.
A lot of people do it.
And we follow <unk> expectations more and higher.
In fact, they <unk> the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in the U.S., much of the people who live under the poverty line have electricity, water, toilets, <unk> television, air conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> of the last century, the <unk> of the planet, would have never dreamed of such <unk>
You know, a lot of this is the technology and lately, its exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that <unk> in information technology jumps on this curve, Moore's Law and doubling the price performance for about 12 to 24 months.
So the mobile phone that you have in your pocket is a million times cheaper and 1,000 times faster than a supercomputer in the 1970s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to watch two things on this curve.
First, how soft it is -- in good and bad times, in war and peace, in recession, in <unk>
It's the result of fast computers used to build faster computers.
It doesn't stop any of the big challenges.
And even though it's <unk> on one law on the left, the curve goes down.
The growth rate of technology is in increasingly faster.
And on this curve, to <unk> from Moore's Law is a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we have today.
<unk> in the cloud, which my friends are called infinite computing, sensors and networks, robotics, 3D printing and their ability to democratize and distribute personalized production across the planet, the synthetic biology, fuels and <unk>
I mean, how many saw the victory on "Jeopardy" in <unk>
It was spade.
I looked at the newspapers, the best headline I <unk>
And I love this: <unk> <unk> <unk>
"Jeopardy" is not a easy play.
Play with the abundant of the human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for everyone on your phone.
Four years ago, here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new college called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can they use to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a product or service, that can affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students today can impact a billion people.
Thirty years ago, that would have <unk> absurd.
Today we can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done.
When I think about creating plenty, it doesn't mean to make life <unk> for every single one who is about creating a life as possible.
It's about taking that thing that is <unk> and making it <unk>
You see, the scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a story of Napoleon <unk> in the <unk>
He's the guy on the left.
<unk> the king of <unk>
The troops of Napoleon ate with <unk> and the same <unk> with gold.
But the king of <unk> ate with <unk> of aluminum.
You see, the aluminum was the most valuable metal on Earth, it was worth more than gold and <unk>
So the tip of the Washington Washington to Washington is <unk>
You see, even though the aluminum is the <unk> of the Earth, it doesn't come as a pure <unk>
It's tied for oxygen and <unk>
But then the <unk> came out of the aluminum thing so cheap that we used it as if it was <unk>
It takes this analogy to the future.
Let's think about energy consumption.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're on a <unk> planet for 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They come to the Earth 16 <unk> of energy every <unk> minutes.
It's not about <unk> it's about <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent less than the generated by <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar power dropped 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that in the end of the decade, in the <unk> parts of the United States, solar power will cost six cents per hour compared to the 15 cents in the national average.
And if we have abundance of energy we also have abundance of water.
So let's talk about the wars for water.
Do you remember when Carl Sagan pointed at the Voyager spacecraft, in the Earth, in 1990, after I went to <unk>
<unk> a big picture -- how do you <unk>
"A <unk> <unk>
Because we live on a water planet.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent of water.
Yes, <unk> is saltwater, two percent is ice, and we fought for the <unk> of the water on the planet, but there's a hope.
It's a technology available not in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes nanotechnology, the <unk>
And in a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators in the <unk> I would like to share with you, gave me permission for the <unk> his technology called <unk> <unk> <unk> is the size of a small sisters.
It is able to generate a thousand liters of drinking water on the day of any <unk> <unk> saltwater, a <unk> for less than two cents the gallon.
The president of Coca-Cola just <unk> that I'm going to do a significant test of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out well, and I have full confidence that it will be, Coca-Cola is going to implement it in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is an innovative innovation for this technology that today exists.
And we've seen it in mobile phones.
My God, we're going to get to 70 percent penetration in the developing world for the end of 2013.
<unk> that <unk> warrior has better cell communications in the middle of Kenya that President Reagan 25 years ago.
And to tell you a smartphone with Google, you have access to more knowledge and information that President Clinton 15 years ago.
It lives in a world of abundance of information and communications and communications that nobody could have ever happened.
Better than that, the things that you and I have paid dozens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- <unk> video libraries -- images, of books and music, tech technology now <unk> and lose value value with mobile phones.
Maybe the best thing comes when you get the health care <unk>
Last month, I had the pleasure to announce with the <unk> Foundation, which was called the X <unk> <unk> <unk>
We are challenging the teams of the world to make these technologies in a mobile device with the talk, and because he has <unk> you can get blood out of your finger.
To win it has to make better diagnostics than a certificate.
So imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there is no doctors, where the burden of <unk> is 25 percent, and there's <unk> of health workers.
When this device is <unk> a virus of RNA or DNA that we don't want to call the <unk> and first of all, stop the pandemic.
But this is the greatest force of producing a world of abundance.
I call it the <unk>
The white lines here are the population.
We just spend the mark of seven billion.
By the way, the best protection against population explosion is to give the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, we went from two billion to five billion Internet users.
Three billion minds before the global conversation add to the global conversation.
What would these people?
What do you think? What romantic wishes would be?
And instead of an economic collapse we have the greatest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of trillion dollars in the global economy.
And <unk> of more health because of the <unk> of a better education with the Khan Academy of <unk> and because of the use of computer impressions and the computer in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can you deliver three billion members of humanity, healthy and <unk>
What about the voices of the voices of the <unk>
What if we give them the oppressed. wherever they are, a voice to be heard and being able to act for the first time?
What do you <unk> these three billion?
And if you are contributions we can't be <unk>
One thing I learned with the X X is that teams guided by their passion with an important goal can do things that were things that could only make big corporations and governments.
I'm going to end up sharing a story that really <unk> me.
There's a program that maybe some of you know.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game that people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how we fold the protein.
The folds determine structure and functionality.
It's a very important thing in medical research.
And so far, it was a problem of <unk>
Have I played with this, university professors, each other.
Then hundreds of thousands of people came together and started <unk>
And it has shown that the pattern of recognition of human patterns is better <unk> protein than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge trust in the future is that we have more power as people to take the big challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the discoveries of the innovative <unk>
We have the capital of the <unk>
And we have three billion minds that are <unk> to work on the solution of big challenges and do what we should do.
We have in front of a few decades there.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
<unk> <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, I will give you three examples to do time.
The first story is about Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
Maybe they believed that it was <unk> but it wasn't like that.
They actually <unk> fish.
And he described to one of them as very <unk>
It was the <unk>
He caught it a lot to the <unk>
Now the fish are at the Red <unk> <unk>
But we've heard this story many times, over the Galapagos and other places, so that has nothing special about it.
But the case is that we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
The leaflets still says they keep <unk>
So what about here?
The second story, it also illustrates another concept.
Because I was there in <unk> studying a <unk> in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought it could be <unk>
I burned a lot of the sun, and I was convinced that I wasn't there.
This is my first exposure to the sun.
The water is surrounded by <unk> and, as you can see, about <unk>
There were <unk> about 20 inch, the black <unk>
And the fishery of this <unk> was very abundant and spent for a good moment, so I was getting more than the average in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later, the number of fish had declined in half.
It goes back to 5 <unk>
Let's have a genetic pressure.
There was still fish.
They were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing in changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was complicit in the introduction of <unk> <unk> in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s, <unk> started in <unk> Europe did a lot of development projects.
The fishing development meant to impose into countries that had 100,000 <unk> <unk> industrial fishing.
And this boat, pretty bad boat, called <unk> four.
I went out to fish in it, and we did studies in the south of the South China Sea, and, mostly in the <unk> Sea.
What we capture was something <unk>
<unk> now I know, sea bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we capture was <unk> other animals that are at the bottom.
And most of the fish are <unk> tiny about <unk> remains that are coral reef <unk>
In short, the bottom of the sea came to the deck and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In one year, you do a study and then start commercial fishing.
The bottom of being a solid coral background, in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a dead <unk>
Not <unk> <unk> because they were dead.
Once we capture a living room.
I was still not <unk>
So they wanted to <unk> because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains what the fishermen collect every time they go to an area where they never have fish.
But it wasn't <unk>
<unk> the world, but we don't remember it.
We took the starting point, at a new level, without remembering what was there.
If you get this something like this.
On the Y-axis, we have things <unk> biodiversity, number of <unk> the <unk> the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Every generation using the <unk> images at the beginning of their conscious life as the normal thing and actually extrapolate forward.
The difference is that they perceive the loss.
But they don't get the loss that happened before.
You can analyze the accumulation of changes.
And in the end to keep some <unk> remains.
And that really is what we want to do right now.
We want to keep things that are no longer what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when <unk> societies kill animals without knowing what they've done to a few generations later.
Because, obviously, an animal that is very plentiful, before <unk> is <unk>
You don't lose animal animals.
You lose animals <unk>
Even if this is not perceived as a great loss.
Over time, we focus on big animals, and in a sea for great fish.
They get <unk> because the <unk>
Over time there are few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, <unk> that was very different.
And they will do it because the evidence presented in an earlier way, is not the way they expected to have evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some of the <unk> as the captain of the captain of the captain and so looked at a lot of fish in this area cannot be used or generally not use the scientists in the fishery, because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we lived in <unk> societies, because they don't rely on the sources of the past.
And so the enormous role that can fulfill a protected marine area.
Because with marine protected areas, we actually recreated the past.
<unk> the past people can't conceive of because the starting point has run and it's very low.
That's for the people that you can see an protected marine zone, and they can benefit from the vision that <unk> which allows them to erase their point of <unk>
And what about the people who can't do that because they have no access, like the Middle East, for example?
I think the arts and cinema may be able to fill the vacuum. The simulation.
This is a simulation of <unk> Bay.
A long time ago, there were gray whales in the Bay Area 500 years ago.
And you may have noticed that the <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about why people were moved with the movie <unk> to talk about the story of <unk> why do they deal with the <unk>
Because it raises something that in some sense, has been lost.
So my <unk> the only one I will give, is <unk> <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hello. I'm Kevin <unk> the <unk> <unk> manager and watch YouTube videos in a professional way.
It's true.
So today we're going to see why the videos are made viral and what's important to do that.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger, that seemed really, really hard.
But today, the web video makes any of us, or from our actions, copper in a part of our world culture.
Anybody can be done on the Internet in a <unk>
They go up over 48 hours of video to YouTube for a minute.
And of those, just a small percentage has a myriad of countless views and it makes cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: creators of trends, and <unk> communities and <unk>
Okay, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh my God, my God.
My God.
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this video shot out of his house in National Park.
In 2010, it was seen 23 million times.
This graph shows the views in the popular rise of last summer.
<unk> didn't say to make a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double <unk>
That's what you do if it's called <unk> Mountain <unk>
I had already published a lot of videos from nature.
This video was published in January.
So what happened here?
He was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this tweet that I took video to the <unk>
The <unk> of trends like Jimmy <unk> are present and interesting things and <unk> to a wider audience.
Rebecca <unk>  He's Friday, Friday. You have to start on your Friday.   You all want to get the end of a week, the weekend.   <unk> Friday.
<unk> <unk> is one of the most popular videos of the year.
You saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
Just like <unk> <unk> this video seemed out of the nothing.
So what did this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask for those other <unk> they're also Friday.
But what happened this day, this Friday <unk>
Well, I took it <unk> and many blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> of <unk> Science Foundation was one of the first people to do a joke about video on Twitter.
But the important thing is that a person or a group of creators are going to take a point of view and share it with a larger audience, accelerating the process.
So this community of people who share this big joke internal and then start talking about that and do things.
And now there are 10,000 <unk> <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each other days.
Unlike <unk> entertainment of the 20th century, this community engagement is our way to be part of the <unk> phenomenon, or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an animation <unk> with a <unk> music.
That's so that's it.
This year you saw about 50 million times.
And if you think that is rare -- you know there's a version of three hours that has seen four million times.
So even the cats saw this video.
And there are cats who saw other cats looking at the video.
But the important thing here is the creativity that aroused between the Internet community.
There was <unk>
Somebody made an old version of it.
And then international did.
Suddenly, I came up a whole community of <unk> that made this happen to be a dumb joke to something that we can all be <unk>
Because today, not just <unk> <unk>
Who might have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted <unk> <unk> or <unk> or <unk> <unk>
What script could have been written that <unk> this situation?"
In a world where two days of video takes up a minute, only the only thing and unexpected can be <unk> so that these things have done.
When a friend told me that I had to see this great video of a guy who protest against the <unk> to <unk> in New York City, I'm going to admit that I didn't interested in too much.
Casey <unk> I was <unk> for not circular for <unk> but often there are obstacles to get paid on the <unk>
KA: Thank you to the surprise effect, and his humor, Casey would have five million to see and understand his idea.
So this approach is worth for everything new that we do.
And this is all leading us to a big question.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
<unk> communities, creative communities, creative communities, are characteristics of a new kind of media -- a new culture, that we all have access and it's the audience that defines the popularity of it.
As I said before, one of the current celebrities of the world, <unk> <unk> started on YouTube.
You don't get permission to express your ideas.
Now we are all a little <unk> of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media -- they're barely the current media today, but they <unk> the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that's still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
So imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a whole life.
He's a poet, a <unk> a man whose entire life had been supported in the unique hope of unit and freedom of his country.
<unk> while the <unk> come into <unk> <unk> the fact that their life had been totally <unk>
The words, for so long, friends, now I <unk>
It was <unk> in silence.
He died broken through history.
He's my grandfather.
I never knew.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother was never allowed to forget his story.
My job was not to let that have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to <unk> but I <unk>
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat at <unk> <unk> <unk>
My mother, <unk> was only 18 years old when his father died, and a <unk> marriage and two little girls.
For it, life had been destined for a <unk> task and a new life in Australia.
It was <unk> for her that I couldn't do that.
And after a <unk> <unk> that defies fiction, a boat slid up into the sea of <unk>
All the adults knew the risks.
The greatest fear was <unk> rape and death.
As most of the adults, my mother had a <unk> with a poison.
If we asked us, first we would take it my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are out of that boat, the constant rate of the engine, the <unk> diving into each wave, and the vast horizon and a vacuum.
I don't remember the pirates that came several times, but they got <unk> with the courage of men on our boat, or the engine dying and not being able to start for six hours.
But I know I remember the lights on the oil platform in front of the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and she died, end the trip was too much to it; and the first apple that I did, given for the men on the platform.
No apple had the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp, in a refugee camp, in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women over three generations to shape a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a <unk> suburb <unk> whose population is composed of immigrants as well.
Unlike the middle class <unk> whose existence was <unk> in <unk> there was no sense of the right.
The smells that came from the stores were the rest of the world.
And the English fragments of English is <unk> among people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then in a car assembly line, working six days, working six days.
Yet, I found time to study English and get a degree in IT <unk>
We were poor.
Every dollars was <unk> and established an extra <unk> in English and mathematics, it wouldn't matter what you ought to think about it was usually <unk> it was always a second hand.
Two pairs of average school, one to hide the holes in the other.
A school uniform to the <unk> because I had to last six years.
And there were <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> <unk>
At home, where?
Something in me is <unk>
He was accumulating determination and a voice saying, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we got <unk> on our day and <unk> the movements of our grandmother's home.
My mother suffered <unk> all the boat.
And my job was to be wakes up until their nightmares started to be able to <unk>
She opened a computer store, and then I studied to be <unk> and opened up another business.
And women were coming with their stories about men who couldn't make the <unk> <unk> and <unk> boys who were caught between two worlds.
They looked for subsidies and <unk>
And they created centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, it was the classical Asian student with what I <unk> from myself.
On the other, I was <unk> in <unk> lives, tragically <unk> by violence, drug abuse and isolation.
But many of them received help over the years.
And by that work, when I was a college studied my last year of <unk> I was elected the Australian young Australian young year.
And I was <unk> from one piece of the puzzle to the other, but the edges of the edges didn't exist.
So <unk> <unk> <unk> was now so <unk> refugee and social activist -- invited to speak in places that I had never heard of, and in houses whose existence would have never ever imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use the <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat into the <unk> and the comfort of life in a <unk> <unk> -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters ending up the day as they did for almost 20 years, <unk> on the day in every single bed.
And I told my mom I couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I had now the same age that she had when we get the boat.
The "no" ever had been an option.
<unk> told me, "and you're not going to be what you didn't expect.
So I talked about <unk> youth and education and <unk> and <unk>
And the more frankly I was talking about it, the more it was <unk> to talk.
I met people from all the roads of life, many of them doing what they were going to be living in the border of possible.
And even though I ended up my <unk> I realized I couldn't stay on a career race.
There had to be another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time as well as a stranger, a <unk> new thing in the scene -- and not only it's fine, but it's something that will be grateful, maybe a ship.
Because to be in it it can easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily mean to accept the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave enough steps out of my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world is <unk> but not the way we fear it.
<unk> they didn't have been <unk> they were <unk> tremendously.
There was a energy there, a optimism -- a rare mix of humility and <unk>
So I kept my intuition.
<unk> a little group of people for the people who can't <unk> it was a <unk> challenge.
For a year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of every day, I made a giant soup pot that all <unk>
<unk> until the night.
Most of our ideas were mad, but some brilliant ones and we open up step.
He made the decision to move to the U.S.
And after one trip.
My <unk>
Three months later, I had <unk> and the <unk> adventure.
Before I finished, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time when the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who mattered to.
Life didn't change for centuries.
Her father died shortly after she was born.
The mother raised alone.
17 became a <unk> of a <unk> whose mother <unk>
Without support of his husband, he caused an <unk> to the <unk> and take the cause her, and much more <unk> caused when I won.
He can't do it proven to be wrong.
I was in the shower at the fourth of a hotel in <unk> when she died, a little bit of <unk>
I looked at the <unk> of the shower and saw it standing on the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and we sat around his <unk>
We tell the stories and made sure that we were still with it.
At the night a <unk> came and told us that I had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to <unk> his hand.
I asked the <unk> "Why his hand is hot, and the rest of the body so <unk>
"Because you have taken your hand from the <unk> he said.
"You have not <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Since we were and how life came into us, we can now see that the men that would have come to our lives and would have been <unk>
The defeat was very easily.
Now I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the boat.
Who might want that to do that.
However, I fear the privilege of the easy, the right.
I can give you a <unk> in your lives, a brave brave <unk> the <unk> rate of the engine, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantee anything?
I don't know.
But if I could give it up and watch it safe it would do.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of this is now in the fourth or the fifth row.
My story starts in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky.
We were having a conversation about how nothing changed since the age of ancient Indian <unk> "The <unk>
In those days when Indians wanted to travel <unk> to a car and <unk> the sky.
We now do it with airplanes.
At that time, when I was <unk> the great prince warrior of <unk> he was <unk> I would pull a bow and a <unk> on the ground, he could find water.
We now do the same with <unk> and machines.
The bottom line was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And that sort of <unk> me.
I felt a little bit more than <unk>
I was <unk> this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't get my friends.
It seemed like the technology had to allow the magic, not <unk>
As a child, my grandfather gave me her <unk> <unk>
And this piece of technological <unk> was for my the most magic thing.
It became a golden door toward a world filled with images of <unk> and <unk> in my imagination.
I had the feeling that the mobile phones -- the luxury clocks and the cameras prevent them out.
<unk> our inspiration.
So I was <unk> I came to this technological world to see how to use it to create magic, instead of <unk>
I had books since the 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad I saw a narrative device able to connect the readers of the entire world.
You can know how we take the book.
Where we are, where we are.
We put the text with the image, animation and touch.
<unk> becomes increasingly <unk>
But what does it do for that?
I'm about to launch <unk> an interactive app for the iPad.
It says, <unk> your fingers on every light."
And so ...  He says, "This box is <unk> I write my name.
And so I get a character from the book.
In several times it comes to me a <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live in the GPS -- that's led to me.
My little girl is excited about all these possibilities.
I've talked a lot of magic.
And I don't mean <unk> and <unk> but that magic magic -- to those ideas that we <unk>
For some reason, fireflies in the jar of the jar of me always <unk>
So over here, we have to change the iPad to release fireflies.
And really, they light your way into what the <unk> of the book.
Another idea that I was fascinated by a little girl was that a whole <unk> galaxy in a <unk>
So here, every book and every world turns into a <unk> that I drag into this magic device inside the device.
And this opens up a map.
In every book of fantasy has always maps but have been static maps there.
This is a map that grows, and you drive it for the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book also <unk>
Now I'm going to come in.
Another important issue for me is to create Indian content and contemporary time.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of <unk> and <unk> but how many people outside India know their counterparts <unk> <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the chambers of Indra for millennia, in an old and <unk> book.
So we're bringing them back into a <unk> <unk>
In a history that is about present issues like the environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems in the last 10 years has been that children have been <unk> attached to their <unk> not the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can get our children to the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions in the book is this adventure that you have to go out outside the outside, take the camera or the iPad, and collect images of different natural objects.
And I had a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For some reason kids don't do it.
So to regain this childhood ritual you have to go out and in a chapter, which is a photo to a flower and then <unk>
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
So this is a digital collection of pictures that can then put on the Web.
A boy in London puts a picture of a <unk> and he says, "Oh, today I saw a <unk>
A boy in India says, "I saw a <unk>
And you create this kind of social network around a collection of digital pictures that have been taking.
Within the variations of connection between magic, Earth and technology are many possibilities.
So in the next book, we have a interaction where you go out with the iPad and the video on and through augmented reality, you see a group of <unk> that appear on inside the inside of the house.
At a moment, the screen is full of leaves on the screen.
And you have to make the sound of the wind and you have to be able to read the rest of the book.
We're going to be a world in which the forces of nature are <unk> with technology and magic and technology and technology to each other.
It <unk> the power of the sun.
We are approaching our children and ourselves to ourselves the natural world and that magic and joy and love love that we felt through a simple story.
Thank you.
I want to tell you about why a lot of <unk> projects.
And I think, really, that the most important thing about that is that we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at the University of <unk> was <unk> to a <unk>
And not a lot of a scientific way, she raised a little coffee cup or tea and asked patients, family and <unk> What would you say?
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think that this is one of the biggest problems for what all of all, or maybe not all of all, but most of the projects of <unk> fail, we stop listening.
This is my Wi-Fi scale. It's a very simple thing.
It has a doorknob on and shut down.
Every morning I was <unk>
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I put myself the challenge to 95 <unk>
But it is so simple that every time I get to me, sends my information to Google <unk>
And my doctor in <unk> has access to him as well. So he can see what my heart problem is not at the same time when it needs to be <unk> or some urgency of that, but it would see it backwards.
But there's another thing.
As some of you know, I have over 4,000 Twitter Twitter on Twitter.
So every morning, I connect myself to my Wi-Fi scale and before you go up to my car, people start to <unk> <unk> today I think you need a light.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure for the pairs used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also for patients to stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can be <unk> to move people out of their chairs and together develop some activity in the order to have more control of their health.
From the next week we will be available.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And people <unk> from their homes, take their blood pressure, they get to their doctor, and share it with others, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, return to <unk> control and be captains of their own <unk> but it can also help care of health care because of the challenges that we face, as the firing cost of the cost of <unk> the <unk> of the demand and other issues.
<unk> techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team.
And you can do it with techniques like this, but also through <unk>
And one of the things we did I'd like to share with you with a video with you.
We all have shipping checks in the <unk>
We may even have them on our phones.
We know perfectly where the <unk> <unk> are <unk>
So where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find fast food.
But where is the closest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked but nobody <unk>
Nobody knew where to get the <unk> saves lives right now.
What we did was do <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the public <unk> you see a <unk> please say, <unk> where, and when it's open, because they sometimes open up in the office and others are closed.
And over 10,000 <unk> they were presented in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the app for that.
And we did an app for the iPad.
We created an app for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time they are in the city of <unk> and somebody <unk> can use your iPhone, and the next few weeks to use their cell phone cell phone to find the nearest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I'd like to introduce this one, not just like <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as a <unk>
And we want to do it globally.
We are <unk> all the colleagues in the world, at other universities, to help us find and work and act like a center for the <unk> of <unk> around the world.
Every time you're on vacation and somebody <unk> can be a relative or someone in front of you, you can find it.
I also want to invite companies around the world that could help us <unk> these <unk>
You might be <unk> or <unk> <unk> for example, to see if the <unk> that shows is still in their place.
Please <unk> on this and not only improve health, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> photograph.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because, of course, they're photographs that can't take with their cameras.
My interest in photography was awakened to my first digital camera at the age of 15 years.
I mixed with my earlier passion for the drawing -- but it was a little bit different because the camera was in the planning was in the planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera the process ends up when you press the <unk>
For me, the photograph had more to do with being in the right place, at the right time.
It seemed like anyone could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that started the press <unk>
<unk> like this is a very <unk> road <unk>
But it has a unexpected.
And despite that, it keeps a level of <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> dark and colorful <unk> but with the common goal of keeping the level of <unk>
And when I say <unk> I mean <unk>
Because, of course, it's not something that can <unk> but I always want it to have been captured in some way like photography.
<unk> where you will have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to do with capturing an idea that with capturing a moment.
But what is the trick that makes it really real?
They're the details or the <unk>
Have the light?
What does the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is a perspective.
But in the end, it's about our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive on a <unk> surface.
It's actually not about whether it's realistic but what we think is realistic.
So I think the basics are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of the reality that we take different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
I'll show you a simple example.
Here is three perfectly <unk> objects that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in some way you can create something that still seems like <unk> as if it existed.
But at the same time, we know that it doesn't exist.
So let's go to the brain because the brain is not embracing the fact that it really doesn't make sense.
And I see the same process by combining the photographs.
It's really about combining different realities.
And the things that make a picture seem realistic and I think they are those ones that we don't even <unk> things around our everyday lives.
But by combining photographs it's very important -- because otherwise something will look wrong.
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules that will go to make realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of pictures must have the same perspective.
Secondly, the <unk> pictures must have the same kind of light.
And these two images meet with these <unk> were taken to the same height and with the same kind of light.
The third point is to do impossible to distinguish the principle and the end of different images with a perfect <unk>
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
Here's another example.
You might think this is the image of a landscape and the lower part is <unk>
But this picture is completely composed of photographs of different places.
In the staff, I think it's easier to create a place that would find it because you don't need to put the ideas that have in the head.
But it takes a lot of planning on it.
And as I thought about this idea in the winter I knew I had several months for <unk> to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing.
The shores are in a different location.
The <unk> was captured in a stone <unk>
And yes, I even made this red house home to make it more <unk>
So to make a result of a realistic results, I think it needs planning to do.
You always start with an idea.
Then we have to combine the different pictures.
And here every piece is very well <unk>
If you do a good job when you take the pictures the result can be very beautiful, and the very <unk>
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'm going to start showing you a slide on a very boring slide.
Please if you can <unk>
It's a diagram that I took from a folder of mine.
I'm not very interested in showing you the details but the general thing.
This is an analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> <unk> versus the power of local area.
What's interesting about this is that this one, as many other that we usually see, is a straight line on a <unk> scale.
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude on the <unk>
I'm going to talk about <unk> <unk> is something that is a new thing.
Here's something strange there.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please light the lights out.
<unk> more intensity because writing on paper.
Why do we <unk> technological curves at <unk>
The answer is that if you draw it into a normal curve in which, say, these are the years of time, or some unit of time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I would like to <unk> the diagram would look something ridiculous.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't tell a lot.
But if you ask for example, for example, some other technology, like transportation, in a <unk> curve, it would be very dumb -- we would see a straight line.
But if something like this, it gives a <unk> change.
If the technology of transportation is as fast as the <unk> past tomorrow we could take a taxi and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go through that rhythm.
There is no <unk> in the history of technological development -- that every few years orders of magnitude.
The question I want to make is -- looking at these curves -- we see that they don't keep forever.
It's not possible to hold this change as fast as it goes.
I want one of two things.
Or it will become a typical <unk> I know how it comes to something completely different, or maybe I'll do something like this.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, and I think maybe something like this.
So we now would be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we're in a transition from what used to be the world, in a new way.
So what I try to ask, and ask myself, what is that new way <unk>
Where new state is the world going.
The transition seems very, very <unk> if we are engaged in it.
I remember a child in the future 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see the future is still the year 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after my life.
But I think it's because we feel something that's going on.
And we can feel a transformation.
And we know that it doesn't have a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because everything is so different than extrapolate what we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how could that transition to <unk>
But to do that will have to talk a little bit of things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking away and looking at the long-term things.
The scale of time I would like to do it is the time of life on Earth.
I think this picture makes sense if we look at each billion years.
So we go back a billion years when the Earth was a great <unk> rock with a lot of chemicals that <unk> around them.
If we look at the way those chemicals organized us a sense of how things happened.
And I think there are theories to start to understand the origin of RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this, and that is that, at that moment, there were <unk> oil <unk> with all kinds of chemical recipes inside.
Some of those oil drops had a particular combination of chemicals that made them to bring out materials from the outside and then the droplets grew up.
And they started <unk>
And in some sense, those were the most <unk> mobile forms -- those <unk> of oil.
But those droplets were not living in the current sense, because each of them contained a random prescription of chemicals.
And every time you <unk> it will be a <unk> distribution of chemicals that <unk>
So every <unk> was a little different.
In fact, the droplets of the droplets are <unk> to be better at the time that we put chemical chemicals together, <unk> more chemicals and <unk> more.
They usually lived longer. They were more <unk>
It was a way of life, a very simple, very simple thing, but things would be interesting to be interesting when these droplets learned the trick of abstraction.
In some way that we don't really understand these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to hold information, which was the recipe of the cell, in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this evolution makes no sense, a writing system that allowed them to record what it was to be able to <unk>
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since it evolved half a half billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes have exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, every living being is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just by <unk> We can now write things with this code.
So here I have 100 <unk> of white dust that I try to hide the Korean security.
But <unk> I took this <unk> The code has the common letters that we tend to use on this -- and I wrote my personal data in this piece of DNA and it <unk> 10 to the <unk>
So if somebody wants 100 million copies of my personal card, I have a lot of all the <unk> in fact, for every person in the world and is here.
If it was a <unk> I would have put it in a virus, and it would have spread it through the room.
What was the next <unk>
Writing DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells happily be happy about another billion years.
But then another great step in which things were <unk> very different and was that these cells started to exchange and communicate information forming the cell communities.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
That way, for example, evolved antibiotic resistance.
Some bacteria found the way to avoid penicillin and <unk> to create their little DNA with other bacteria, and now there are a lot of resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication gave place that they would be able to get communities that in a way, were together in it, and a <unk>
And so <unk> or <unk> together, or whether if a community was very successful all the individuals of that community, they got more and they were <unk> by evolution.
And the tipping point occurred when these communities came up and they actually came together and decided to write the whole recipe for the community board in a string of DNA.
The next stage in life took another billion years old.
And at that stage we have <unk> communities from many different kinds of cells working together as a single organism in this organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell is not like without the heart, or the <unk> or the brain, and so on.
So these communities evolved and created more interesting levels than cell phone, something we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
These were <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that they didn't do more than process information in community.
It's the <unk> structures.
<unk> are the gadgets that process the information that those cell communities built.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being responsible for <unk> and understanding and transmitting the information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system in those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that moment as <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not the period of evolutionary time.
So one organism could, for example, learning not to eat some fruit. Because he knew bad and got sick the last time it ate it.
That could happen during the life of an organism given that they had built these information processing structures that by evolution would have learned for hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals who ate that fruit.
So the fact that the nervous system would build these structures of information <unk> enormously the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen confined to an individual.
It could happen in the time we need to learn.
But then, of course, the individuals discovered the trick of communication.
So for example, the most <unk> version that we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea, a <unk> idea.
I'm sitting here <unk> and hopefully building a similar idea, <unk> and <unk> in their heads that saved some analogy with mine.
But we take something very complicated that we turned it into sound, in sound sequences.
That is now allowing us to start working as a organism.
In fact, like humanity, we started making <unk>
We now move through periods of similar periods to the <unk> organisms -- our <unk> methods and data processing and information processing.
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
The computer <unk> the computer tape -- the <unk> and so forth, and so on.
And that brings us into something much larger, faster and able to evolve more than we did before.
Now evolution can happen on microseconds.
You saw the evolutionary <unk> <unk> where there was some evolution with the <unk> program in our eyes.
And now we've accelerated time time again.
The first stages of the story that I told you took a billion years each.
The next few the nervous system and the brain, took about hundreds of millions of years.
<unk> and so forth, they took less than a million years.
And the <unk> like the electronics, it seems to be just a few decades.
The process is <unk> I guess <unk> is the right word to name something that accelerates its own pace of change.
The more it changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion of the curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I make my life designing computers, and I know that the mechanisms that work for <unk> would not be possible without the recent design technologies.
But now design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me to <unk>
I don't know that every transistor in that machine <unk>
There are billions.
Instead of that, with the designers of <unk> <unk> we think a level of abstraction, we put it into the machine and the machine that does something that I didn't do before, it gets much further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes it uses methods that don't even understand well.
A particularly interesting method that I've been using lately, is evolution itself.
We put into the machine an evolutionary process that operates on the scale of the microseconds.
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please computer -- you can run a hundred million sequences of instructions to chance?
You could run these sequences of instructions at random, running all those programs, and take those who are more <unk> what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
So let's say I want to tell numbers, to put a simple example.
So we found the programs that are closer to order to order numbers.
Of course, it's unlikely that some random sequences of instructions, <unk> numbers, so none of them did it.
But one, luckily, it could find two numbers in the right order.
And I said, <unk> could you take 10 percent of those random sequences that I better did the <unk>
You get those and <unk> the rest.
And now we have to get the best to <unk> the numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of analog to <unk>
Let's take two programs, which <unk> kids, that <unk> <unk> and that the children are <unk> the properties of both programs.
So we managed to get a new generation of programs from the combinations of programs that had a little more successful.
And say, "Please do the <unk>
<unk> again.
We get some mutations in it.
And it tries again and it tries again to <unk> it with another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or in complicated cases, in a few hours.
At the end, we ended up with shows that you have programs very completely perfect.
In fact, they are much more efficient at which I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs, I can't tell you how they work.
I've tried to analyze it to see how they work.
These are dark blue programs.
But they do the <unk>
In fact, I know, I have the security that we get the goal because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that did it.
In fact, their lives are dependent on doing that.
I was once on a 747 with <unk> <unk> and he takes a card on and says, "Look at this.
It says, <unk> airplane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> that work together to give you a <unk> flight.
We know that the engineering processes don't work very well when they're <unk>
So we started to rely on computers to make a different design processes.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than produces normal engineering.
However, we don't understand the whole options that there is.
In that sense, it goes in front of us.
We now use those programs to make a lot faster and so that they can run these programs much more quickly.
I mean, they <unk>
The thing is getting faster and faster and so I think it seems so <unk>
Because all these technologies are <unk>
We are <unk>
And we're at an analogous moment to the <unk> organisms when they became <unk>
We are <unk> and we can't understand what the hell are we creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant to think that we are the end product of evolution.
And I think that all of us are part of the creation of what it is.
But now comes the lunch and I think it will stop here before I <unk>
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that must change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've spent enough time to allow me to give up part of my fake <unk> in that.
Before I deal with my talk, let's talk a little baseball.
Why not?
We're near the end of the <unk> the World Wide <unk>
We love baseball, right?
baseball is full of amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's going to be <unk> <unk> talks about the statistics and used to use them to form a great baseball team.
I'm going to focus on one of you and I hope that many of you know.
It's called average <unk>
And we're talking about 300 percent of a <unk> that <unk> 300.
That means the bat <unk> three of 10 times.
That means throwing the ball into the game of play without being <unk> and anyone who is going to get to the first base, not to get time, and the second foundation will be <unk>
Ten <unk>
You know what you call a <unk> <unk> in the Great <unk>
Well, really well, maybe the team of the stars.
You know how they call a baseball <unk>
By the way, that's someone that from 10 <unk> I get four.
<unk> like the legendary Ted Williams, the last player of the League <unk> of <unk> in <unk> <unk> in a regular season.
Now let's get this to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable or maybe less awkward, after what I'll tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and they have a surgeon who has a record of 400 to <unk>
So it doesn't work, right?
Now suppose they live in a place and a dear <unk> has two clogged arteries and your family doctor puts it from a cardiologist whose record record is <unk>
But you know what?
She's getting very much better.
And its hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But you ask them to ask them.
What do you think about the average of the hits of a heart <unk> or a nurse or a <unk> <unk>
<unk> very well.
And the truth of the issue is that nobody in the medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, of a doctor or <unk>
What we do, though, is sending them into the world, and I included me, with the <unk> of being perfect.
I would never, ever make a mistake and figure out how to do it well.
That was the message that I was interested in when I was in medical school.
I was a <unk> <unk>
Once, a fellow in high school said that Brian <unk> studied until a blood <unk>
Such which.
<unk> in my little <unk> at the nurses of the General of Toronto, not far away from here.
And I learned all of the memory.
From my first class of anatomy, <unk> the origin and the muscle work, the fork in every artery that comes out of the <unk> the frequent <unk> and the usual <unk>
And I even knew the differential diagnosis about how to classify the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as much more <unk> and more knowledge.
And I was very nice. I graduated from <unk>
And <unk> from the school of medicine with the impression that if you knew everything, then they would know everything, or the most possible thing to do, because I get rid of the mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met Mrs. <unk>
I was a resident in a college hospital here, in Toronto, when brought it to the <unk> lady in the emergency room where I worked.
At that moment I was assigned to the service of <unk>
And when the emergency room applied to a cardiologist really touched that patient.
And reporting the head of residents.
When I saw Mrs. <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a sound <unk>
And when the <unk> I heard a <unk> sound in both sides, which sent me a heart failure.
In these conditions, the heart is going to work and, instead of pump the blood forward, the blood goes to the lungs, these are <unk> and that's why there's difficulty breathing.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I started working on the treatment that I was <unk>
I gave him <unk> and medication to alleviate pressure in his heart.
I gave it <unk> <unk> for the water, so that it could eliminate liquid.
And in an hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I felt very well.
And that's when I made the first <unk> he sent her home.
I really made two more errors.
He sent her home without talking to the chief of the residents.
I didn't get the phone and I didn't do what I should have done, which was to call my boss and <unk> with him for him to <unk>
And if my boss had seen it, I would have been able to bring <unk> information.
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident that was constant attention.
Perhaps I wanted to be so successful and able to take care of my patients without even contact my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
And he was able to send it home, he didn't take a voice to a voice in my inside and said, <unk> is not a good idea.
In fact, I was so insecure that I was able to ask the nurse who <unk> the Mrs. <unk> believe it's okay if he goes to his <unk>
And the nurse thought, and then he said, <unk> <unk> "Yes, I think I'll be okay."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So he signed the high, and the ambulance next to the <unk> was taken her home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad <unk> in the stomach.
But I went on with my work.
At the end of the day, I went down to leave the hospital and walked into the parking lot where my car was in order to go home. At that moment I did something I don't do normally, I don't do something that I don't do.
It went through the emergency emergency room home.
And there another nurse, not the <unk> of the Mrs. <unk> before, but another three words, those three words that most of the medical emergency doctors.
Other specialists fear it, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and that is that we see patients <unk>
The three words are: <unk>
<unk> the patient who sent his <unk>
He asked the other nurse with total <unk>
And she said, she <unk> with the same tone of voice.
She was okay.
But I went back and on the edge of death.
By an hour of having gotten to her home, after I was <unk> he had a collapse and his family called the <unk> the <unk> brought her to the emergency room with a blood pressure on 50 inches of <unk> which means a shock <unk>
I would just breathe and was blue.
The emergency room is <unk> all their resources.
They gave him medication to raise blood pressure.
And they put a <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
He had a mixture of feelings because after the <unk> was in intensive therapy and waiting for every hope that they were <unk>
And in the two or three days it was clear that you never <unk>
It had permanent damage damage.
The family came together.
And in eight or nine days, it was <unk> what was going on.
And in ninth day, the lady will go. <unk> wife, mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names that they die.
That was my first experience.
And the weeks later, I was excited about it and experienced by the first time the shame that exists in our medical culture, and I felt lonely, <unk> without feeling that healthy shame because you can't get them with your colleagues.
You make the peace and never make that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teaching.
<unk> <unk> that I talk about is that makes us feel very bad inside.
It is the one that tells us not that what we did was not bad, but we are bad.
And that felt it.
And it wasn't for my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family, and I'm sure I would get the things and make sure that I didn't get <unk>
And I kept getting those questions.
Why didn't I ask my <unk> Why did he sent his home?
And in my worst <unk> Why I made a mistake so <unk>
Why chose medicine?
Gradually, that feeling was <unk>
And I started feeling better.
And on one day, it was opened up the sky and finally came out, and I wondered if I had felt better again.
And I did a deal with me in which if I <unk> the efforts to be perfect for not to make more errors, I would mean by those voices.
And it did.
I went back to work.
But it came back again.
Two years later, I was an <unk> in the emergency room in a community hospital north of Toronto, and I got a <unk> man with a pain in <unk>
I was very busy and <unk>
He pointed out here.
I looked into his throat, I was a little <unk>
He threw him penicillin and he sent him home.
But as he was headed to the door still pointing his <unk>
Two days later, when I came to make my guard, my head asked to talk to me in his office.
And he made the three words: Does it remember you?
Remember the patient who saw by pain in <unk>
He came back and didn't have a <unk> <unk>
He had a potentially fatal condition called <unk>
You can search for Google. It's an infection, it's an infection, it's an infection, and it can cause the closing of those tracks.
He, fortunately, she didn't die.
They were <unk> antibiotics in the <unk> and they recovered to the few days.
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> and then I went back and went back to work, until over and over again, and over again.
Two times in the same <unk> <unk>
And it's a great effort, especially working in a hospital, because it was <unk> at 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought I had a calculus <unk>
He <unk> an X-ray of kidneys, but it turned normal -- a colleague that was checking out the patient <unk> some sensitivity in the lower right-hand corner.
The other patient was with a lot of diarrhea.
I read liquid order for <unk> and I asked my colleague to <unk>
I looked at it and when I saw some sensitivity in the bottom right-hand corner, he called the surgeon <unk>
Both of them were operated and they recovered <unk>
But every case I was <unk> I was <unk>
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise, and as many colleagues say, it's a <unk>
The most meaningful have been over the last five years.
<unk> embarrassed and no support.
And here's the problem: If I can't come to me and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what it really happens, how can you share this with my <unk>
How do I show you this for the same <unk>
If I had a place like this, I would have no idea what you think about me.
When did the last time you heard somebody talk about failure, after failure, after failure, after failure?
Of course at a party you'll hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but you're not going to hear somebody talking about their own errors.
And if I knew and my colleagues also, that a <unk> in my hospital <unk> the wrong leg. I think I would have a hard time to look at the eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of mistakes.
It is the system where there are two <unk> that they make mistakes and don't sleep that you can't sleep and the ones that I know; which have <unk> outcomes and those who have great outcomes.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction like antibodies that start to attack that person.
We have the idea that if you get a drug out of medicine to people who make mistakes, we'll get a safe system.
But it brings two problems.
In 20 years about diffusion and medical journalism, I've made a personal study for bad medical <unk> and medical failures to learn how possible, from the first article I wrote for the Toronto, "Star <unk> to my <unk> <unk> Black <unk> white art.
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We work in a system where the mistakes happen every day, where one in 10 drugs are <unk> in the hospital are wrong, or <unk> is not correct. In a system in which <unk> infections, are increasingly <unk> and more <unk> causing chaos and death.
In this country, thousands of <unk> die by errors in <unk>
The Institute of Medicine, established 100,000.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And that's what things are.
A <unk> system where knowledge is doubling every two or three years, and we don't get to us.
<unk> sleep is <unk>
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow you to make a perfect history of a patient with chest pain.
Now, let's take the same patient with a chest pain -- comes <unk> with <unk> eyes, and with breath to alcohol and all of a sudden, my story would be <unk> of contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things always the same.
And my patients are not cars. They didn't recognize their symptoms always the same way.
So the mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system like we <unk> and we eliminate all the bad professionals -- well, it's not going to be anyone.
And what people don't want to talk about their most <unk>
In my <unk> <unk> white art, <unk> is a custom to say, "This is my worst <unk> I would tell you, from the <unk> to the chief of surgery, <unk> "This is my worst <unk> blah blah. What are your <unk> and <unk> the microphone toward them.
And his students were <unk> to go down to your head, and they would have to tell their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
<unk> to say, "Look, they didn't make the same <unk>
They need a context where we can do it.
They need a <unk> medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The <unk> doctor is human, the human, they accept it, and it's not proud of your mistakes, but it's trying to learn from what happened to teach others.
They get their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their errors.
<unk> the mistakes of other people don't have the intention of <unk> but in a loving way, and the support for everyone else is <unk>
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that human beings run the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes in time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk> doctor.
I'm human, <unk> mistakes.
And I feel a lot of effort and effort to learn something that can convey to others.
I still don't know what to think about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words: <unk> I remember it.
Do you know how many decisions we take a day <unk>
Do you know how much we choose in a week?
I recently made a survey for more than 2,000 people and the average amount of choices that says to pick an average American, are about 70 to a day.
Not a lot ago, in a research followed for a week to a bunch of business companies.
The researchers recorded the different tasks of <unk> for these executives and time that they are going to be able to make related decisions.
They found that on average, <unk> <unk> works for week.
Naturally, every job included lots of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent required an hour or more of its time.
Now think about your elections.
Do you know how many belong to the category of nine minutes, and how many of an hour?
How do you have the way to deal with those decisions?
I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of the <unk> to choose to the <unk> of options.
I want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions.
As I talk about this I'm going to ask you a few questions and I need to know how to know the answers.
When I do a question, like I'm blind, raise your hand just if you want to burn calories.
Otherwise, when you do a question, if your answer is positive please give a <unk>
And now my first question on the day, you're ready to hear the problem of the <unk> <unk> problem.
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at Stanford University, <unk> this <unk> <unk> <unk> at least in that time was very sophisticated.
It was called <unk>
It was almost like going to a park in <unk>
There were like 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> over 500 different kinds of fruits and vegetables and some 25 of the water <unk> and this was when you take water from the tap.
I loved going to that shop, but on one occasion, I asked myself, why did I never buy nothing?
This is the shelf on <unk> oil.
They had more than 75 different classes, including those who were in <unk> box that came from trees.
I once decided to visit the manager and asked him, <unk> this strategy of offering all these <unk>
He pointed to me with the buses full of tourists every day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to make a little experiment with <unk> This is the <unk>
hall.
They had different classes.
<unk> a <unk> for <unk> just to the store.
We put it out there six <unk> or 24 tastes and look at two things: First, what case people were willing to stop trying to stop the <unk>
More people stopped stopped when there were <unk> a 60, that when there were only six, a 40 percent.
We also looked at what case they were more likely to buy a jar of <unk>
Here we find the opposite effect.
What stopped when there were only three percent, only three percent came to buy <unk>
And what they stood when there were six, we saw 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, people had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they found six.
Well, we decide that we don't buy <unk> <unk> it's probably <unk> it's less good for conserving <unk> but it turns out that the problem of the choices is affecting us in <unk> decisions.
We decided to do not decide, even though this is not <unk>
Now the issue of the day, the financial savings.
I'm going to describe to you a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we looked at the savings decisions for the retirement decisions about a million Americans, in between 650 plans in this country.
We were interested to see if the number of funds funds available to savings plans for retirement, the <unk> program, <unk> people to save the future.
And we found that it actually had a <unk>
We had <unk> plans from two, to 59 different options.
We found that the older it was the number of funds there were less participation.
So if we look at the ends, we see that in the plans for two funds, the rate of participation was 70 percent or more, not as high as they wanted to.
And in the plans that offered about 60 funds, the rate of engaging the <unk> <unk>
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when there is more choices, even in that case, there are the negative consequences.
So for those who decided to participate, the bigger it was the number of options, more people are <unk> to avoid stocks or funds for investment.
As soon as I had more choices, they were more willing to invest in financial accounts.
But none of these extreme choices are the ones that we are <unk> to optimize the future financial well-being.
In the previous decade we've seen three main negative consequences to the most possibilities.
The most likely thing is that we need the decision, that the <unk> even when this is against their self-interest.
It's more likely to take the worst decisions in finance and health.
Are you more likely to pick things less <unk> even though objectively it <unk>
The main reason is that we have to look at that giant variety of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations for <unk> and to choose that awesome <unk>
I want to give you four simple techniques that we have <unk> in one way or another, in different research, so that they can test in their business.
The first one is, <unk>
You have heard it before, but it has never been more true than today, less than today, that's less than today, that's less.
People are always upset when I say, <unk>
They care about losing space in the <unk>
But actually what we're looking at more and more is that if you try to cut, get rid of <unk> options -- there will be a <unk> increase in sales, there will be a better experience in the election.
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different kinds of <unk> & <unk> at 15, you saw a 10 percent increase in sales.
When the <unk> Golden <unk> eliminated the products for <unk> of cats that are less <unk> the <unk> in <unk> for two <unk> major sales and smaller costs.
You know that today's average income is offered 45,000 products.
In a <unk> shop there is about 100,000 products.
But the largest store in the world today is <unk> and it offers only 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato sauce on <unk>
In the world of financial savings world, I think one of the best examples that has emerged about how to manage the choices is the <unk> David <unk> <unk>
All of the employees at Harvard are <unk> automatically at a certain quality of life.
Those who really want to choose to choose are offered to you 20 or more.
You know that often people say, "I don't know how to <unk>
They're all <unk> options.
The first thing I do is ask the <unk> <unk> the differences that there are between those options.
And if your employees can't afford it, you can't do it either.
This afternoon, before I started this session, I was talking about <unk>
He told me that I would be willing to offer people in this audience of this audience on a vacation with everything they paid the <unk> road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave a few seconds to <unk> and then I want you to take a applause if you're ready to take the supply of <unk>
<unk> <unk> Okay. Whatever is ready to accept the supply.
They're not else?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who is ready for that <unk>
I think I really had to hear more hands.
All right.
In fact, you had more information in the first trial, which in the second hand, but I can tell you what they thought the second time was real.
Because the images made it more real.
This brings me to the second technique to deal with the <unk> problem of the <unk> which is <unk>
For people to understand the differences between choices, they have to understand the consequences of every choice, and that the consequences must feel very very <unk>
Why do people spend 15 percent more on average when it uses credit cards or credit card than when it uses <unk>
Because it doesn't seem real money.
It turns out that making it more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to get more of them.
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> who worked in <unk> these people were at a meeting where they were <unk> to a <unk> plan.
At that meeting that we would see exactly like <unk> we did a little <unk>
What we added was that I would give you the staff to think about the positive things that you would care about their lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in the <unk> of 20 percent, and an increase in how much they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put in their <unk> <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can handle more categories than options.
For example, this is a study that we did in a row.
We saw that in supermarkets, <unk> across the <unk> <unk> the magazine exhibit can hold from <unk> different kinds of <unk>
But, you know?
Because the rating tells me how to <unk>
These are two pieces of <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other, <unk>
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> Give them a <unk>
<unk> <unk> Well, there's some of them.
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> Give them a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> But you know something?
This rating framework is totally useless.
The categories must tell you something that they <unk> not the <unk>
You often see this problem with those huge <unk> <unk>
You're supposed to be <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out that we can manage a lot more information than we think, if you just put it a little bit.
We need to increase the gradually.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's look at a good decision, the purchase of a car.
This is a <unk> German manufacturer that lets <unk> completely.
You have to take 60 decisions to put the car.
And these decisions vary in the number of options that there is each one.
<unk> color out of the car. I have 56 possibilities.
<unk> box <unk>
What I'm going to do is change the order in which the decisions.
So half of the clients are going to go from a lot of choices, 56 colors, just about four and four boxes.
The other half of customers are going to go from few choices, four <unk> to 56 colors, a lot of options.
And what am I going to <unk>
How about it is.
If you <unk> it always the default button in every decision, this indicates that they're <unk> or <unk> we are <unk>
We found that they go from a lot of options that go from a few choices to a few and over and over again, and another more.
The <unk>
If you go from a few options to many, you continue there.
The same information, the same number of options.
The only thing I did was <unk> the order in which the information is presented.
If we start with the easy, you learn to <unk>
Although the choice of change is not going to say nothing about the preferences of internal decoration.
We are excited about a product that we're building that now has more <unk> with the process.
So to sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> we can handle more categories at least <unk> <unk> complexity.
All of these techniques that I've presented them were designed to help drive the <unk> or better, for you, to use them in their own business, or for people who are working.
It is that I think the key to the best of an election is being careful the <unk>
And the more careful we be in our choices we can do the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the <unk> years in East Germany, <unk> if you had a typewriter that they had to write to the government.
There was to record a leaf sheet, which was written with the machine.
And this is for the government to track the origin of texts.
If they found a piece of the wrong message they could track the footprint up to the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't think that someone could do this, how much it would make the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser color printer in any big manufacturer and it prints a page, that page is going to end up with some yellow printed dots on every page that are still a pattern that makes them own one and your printer.
That's happening today.
And nobody seems <unk> so much for this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, the citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems in the network.
If we look at what happens in the online world, we can install the attacks on their <unk>
There are three main groups.
Are you the <unk>
As Mr. <unk> <unk> from the city of <unk> in Ukraine.
The mobile phone phone is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use the <unk> to make a lot of money, a large amounts.
There are really many cases of online online cases, <unk> money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, <unk> <unk> etc., etc.
These guys do their <unk> online, but they do it by illegal means by <unk> banking to steal money from our bills when we buy a <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we bought on a computer computer.
The secret <unk> of the U.S., two months ago, <unk> this Swiss account of this guy, Sam <unk> and this has <unk> million dollars when it was frozen freezing.
Mr. <unk> is <unk> you know his <unk>
And I say that today you are more likely to be the victim of a <unk> that is a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this goes wrong in worse.
In the future, most crimes of online crimes online.
The second group of <unk> in importance that we see today is not driven by the money.
There is another thing that moves, and they motivate them the protests, they motivate them <unk> and they motivate them laughter.
Groups like Anonymous have <unk> over the last 12 months occupying a huge role in the online attacks.
Those are the three main <unk> the criminals who do it for money, the <unk> like Anonymous that do it to protest and the last group are the national <unk> the governments that <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of government attack against its own citizens.
<unk> is a <unk> authority in the Netherlands, or actually, it was.
<unk> the last fall because of a <unk>
<unk> the security of the site and given a <unk>
Last week I asked him at a meeting with Dutch government, I asked one of the leaders if they were <unk> <unk> death of people because of the attack on <unk>
And the answer of him was yes.
So how does people die from a attack on these?
<unk> is an <unk> authority.
<unk> <unk>
Why do you make the <unk>
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> services like <unk>
Except that <unk> an foreign authority to <unk>
And then the <unk> <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it was exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt the <unk> of the police police headquarters in April 2011, and during the <unk> of the building, they found a lot of papers.
Among those papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder there was notes of a company based on Germany who had sold the Egyptian government tools to intercept a large scale the communications of the country.
They had sold this tool for 3,000 euros to the <unk> government.
The company headquarters is right here.
I mean, the Western governments give them tools for governments to do that to make their citizens.
But Western governments also do this themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago, found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by government officials to investigate their own citizens.
If you're suspicious of a criminal case, you know, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today it goes further.
You get the connection to the Internet.
So even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all the communication, and listen to the online discussions online, to get our data.
When we think carefully about things like these the obvious answer should be like, "Well, it looks bad, but it doesn't really affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why is it <unk>
I have nothing to <unk>
And that argument doesn't make sense.
It's in <unk>
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a matter of privacy against safety.
It's about freedom against control.
If we could be able to rely on our governments today in 2011, any right of the right that <unk> today will be forever.
<unk> <unk> in any future government, in a administration that we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that must be worried about the next 50 years.
Here is where I live in Kenya, in the southern part of Nairobi.
These are the cows of my dad, at the bottom, and behind the cows, the National Park in Nairobi.
The National Park in Nairobi doesn't have fences in most of the South, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate freely out of the park.
And predators, like their lions, and this is what they do.
<unk> our cattle.
This is one of the people who killed at night, and so soon we wake up in the morning and we found dead I was very bad because it was the only <unk> we had.
My community, the <unk> we believe that we came from the sky with our animals and the whole land to <unk> and so we value it so much.
So I grew up <unk> a lot of lions.
Those are people who protect our community and livestock and livestock are also mad at the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions who killed in Nairobi.
I think that's why there are so few in the National Park in Nairobi.
A child in my community, from six to nine years old, is responsible for livestock of their father and this was the same thing that was happening to me.
So I had to find a way to fix this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought the lions were afraid.
But I realized that this was actually not <unk> because it even helped the lions see the pen away.
I don't get <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
She was trying to <unk> lions so they believed that I was near the <unk>
But male lions are very smart.  They came up the first day and saw the <unk> and they were, but the second day, they came back and they said, this thing is not moving, it's always here.  So I went and killed the animal and killed the animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day lions didn't come back.
I found that lions are afraid of the light that moves around.
So I had an idea.
And I got a light switch that I got to turn the lights off.
And this is a little lamp of a <unk> <unk>
<unk> everything.
As you can see, the solar cell takes the battery and the battery <unk> the electricity to the little box -- I call it a transformational.
And the <unk> box makes the lights on.
As you can see, the <unk> get outside, because that's where the lions.
And that's how they see lions when they come from night.
The lights and <unk> and <unk> the lions to think that I'm walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago and since then we never went back to the lions.
And the neighborhood houses heard the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals who had killed a lot of animals and asked me if I could put the lights on.
I said yes.
You can see them, you can see the bottom, these are the lights on lions.
Since then, I've installed them at seven houses in my community and they're serving a lot.
And my idea is also used now throughout Kenya, to scare other predators like <unk> <unk> and it's also using to be <unk> elephants from it.
And thank you to this invention, I was fortunate enough to get a grant from one of the best schools in Kenya, <unk> School, and I'm very excited.
My new school is now helping raising funds and <unk>
It even took my friends to my friends, and we set up lights in the houses that don't have, and I teach them how to <unk> them.
So a year ago, it was just a kid in the <unk> <unk> the cows of my father, and I used to see flying airplanes and he told me that someday it would be within one.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come in airplane for the first time at TED.
My great dream is to get to be an engineer of aviation and pilot when I grow up.
I used to hate the lions, but now as my invention is saving the cows of my dad and the lions, we can be with lions with no conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my language means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture how exciting it is to hear a story like you.
So you got a <unk> Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working on other electrical inventions.
What's the next thing on your list?
<unk> My next invention -- I want to do a close to CA: <unk> <unk>
<unk> I know they were invented virtual fences -- but I want to do mine.
CA: You would have it once once, right? And <unk> <unk> I've tried it before, but I stopped because I got a <unk>  CA: On the foot, Richard <unk> is a big thing.
We're going to get it in every step that you have a friend of mine.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a little, I thought my country was the best on the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called <unk> <unk> nothing."
And I felt very proud.
In school, we would come all the time by studying the history of Kim <unk> but we never learned a lot of the rest of the world, except that America, South Korea are the enemies.
Although sometimes I asked myself about the rest of the world, I thought I was going to spend all my life in North Korea, until everything changed in a <unk>
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public performance.
But I thought my life in North Korean was normal.
My family wasn't poor and I was never hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister.
I said, "When we do this, the five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the two weeks now.
We're <unk> together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak, we are ready to die."
I was very altered.
It was the first time I heard that people were suffering in my country.
At the time when I was walking in front of the train, I saw something terrible that I can't erase my memory.
A woman who had no life was dead on the street holding a <unk> child in his arms looking at his face of his mother without being able to do anything.
No one was <unk> because they were very concerned about taking care of them and their families.
A huge starvation <unk> in North Korea in the <unk>
In the end, over a million North Koreans died during famine and only few survived eating grass, insects and <unk>
They also became more and more <unk> the <unk> of energy, everything around me was completely <unk> at night except by the light lights in China, barely crossing the river from my house.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a satellite photo of North Korea at the night compared to the neighboring countries.
This is the <unk> river that serves between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North Koreans to be <unk>
But many people die.
Sometimes, I see bodies floating in the river.
I can't reveal the details of the North Korea, but I can only say that during the years of starvation I went to China to live with relatives <unk>
But I just thought I'd be separated from my family for the short time.
I could never have imagined it would take back 14 years to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea what life would be like <unk>
But soon I learned that it's not just extremely hard, but it's also dangerous, because North North refugees in China were considered illegal <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible fate back in North Korea.
One day, my worst nightmare was actually done when I was arrested for the Chinese police and I was <unk> in the police station.
Somebody had been accused by being <unk> so I <unk> my skills in the Chinese language, and they asked me many questions.
He was <unk>
I thought my heart was <unk>
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end.
But I managed to control my emotions and answered the questions.
At the end of the <unk> an officer said to the other, "This was a fake <unk> she's not <unk>
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China looking for asylum <unk>
But many of them can be arrested for the Chinese police and <unk>
These women were very lucky.
Although the <unk> had eventually been released after a hard international pressure.
These North Koreans were not so lucky.
Every year, countless North Koreans are captured in China and <unk> to North Korea, where they're <unk> imprisoned or executed in public.
Although I was lucky to get away many other North Koreans have not had so much luck.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard just to survive.
Even after learning a new language, and to find work, everybody can get it in a moment's second.
That's why after 10 years of hiding my identity, I decided to risk South Korea here.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a much larger challenge than I had expected.
English was very important in South Korea, and I had to start learning my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and South Africa.
We are all <unk> but in the inside, we've come to be very different because of 67 years of <unk>
I even went through an identity.
I'm a <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
Suddenly there was no country that I could call with mine.
Although I went to life in South Korea it wasn't easy, and I started to study for the income exam to college.
Just when I was starting to <unk> my new life, I got an alarming call.
The authorities in North Korea took some money that I sent to my family, and as a result, my family was going to be shifted to force to the force to a location outside of the <unk>
They flee immediately.
I started planning how to help them escape.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way toward freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Africa.
So, ironically, I took a flight to China and I went to the border with North Korea.
Because my family couldn't speak Chinese, I had to <unk> in some way, for more than 3,000 miles across China, and then across Southeast Asia.
The trip in <unk> took a week, and we were almost caught several times.
Once, our bus was stopped and tackled by a Chinese police officer.
He asked the <unk> and started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese officer came to me to my family, <unk> I stood up and told me that they were <unk> people who were <unk>
I looked at me <unk> but fortunately they believed me.
We did all the way down to the border of <unk>
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the guards <unk> in <unk>
But even after the border, my family was arrested and imprisoned by crossing the border <unk>
After paying <unk> and bribes, my family was released in a month.
But the time, my family was busted and incarcerated again in the capital of <unk>
This was one of the lowest points in my life.
I made everything for free to release my family, and we were so close to it, but my family was <unk> in the <unk> in the embassy of South Korea.
I was going to be in between the immigration office and the police station, desperately trying to release my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that moment, or the voice of a man ask, "What is the problem?"
I was so surprised that a stranger would care to ask.
With my poor English and a dictionary, I told him the situation, and without <unk> the man was the <unk> and gave me the rest of the money for my family and for other two North Koreans and take it out of prison.
I read it with my entire heart, and I asked her, "Why am I <unk>
"I'm not <unk> he told me.
"I'm helping the village <unk>
I realized that that was a symbolic moment in my life.
The <unk> <unk> a new hope for me and for the village to get it to the <unk>
And I showed me that the kindness of strangers and the support of the international community are really the rays of hope that the village <unk> needs.
Over time, after our long journey, my family and I met in South Africa.
But achieve freedom is only half the struggle.
A lot of North Koreans are separated from their families, and when they went to a new country, they start with little or nothing of money.
So, we can benefit from the international community with education, practice of the English language, labor practices, and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people in North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because many of us keep in contact with the family still inside, and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from inside.
I've been very <unk> I've received a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help the North Koreans a chance of <unk> for international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North Koreans all over the world, including the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in South <unk>
This is <unk> Center for <unk> food, fast <unk>
So the city planners came together and thought, let's go to change the South Center for them to represent something else, so they changed the South Angeles -- as if this is actually going wrong in the city.
This is the South Angeles --  <unk> of <unk> food, fast <unk>
Just like <unk> millions of other live Americans, in a desert food, Los Angeles and <unk> to the food places to take and eat and eat in the car.
The funny thing is that the food places to bring people to kill more people than food in the car.
People are dying of <unk> diseases in Los Angeles <unk>
For example, the rate of obesity in my neighborhood is five times larger than say, <unk> <unk> which is like 15 miles away.
I want me to see this happen.
And I wonder, how would you feel like they didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time they come home you see the <unk> effects that the current food system has in their <unk>
I saw <unk> chairs and sold like cars. cars.
I see <unk> centers like <unk>
And I think this must stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
<unk> is the problem and it's the solution.
And I'm also tired of driving 45 minutes of <unk> and back to buy an apple that doesn't have pesticides.
What I did, was planting a food forest in front of my house.
In a sliver of land that we call a <unk>
It's 45 percent of me.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to keep it over.
I said, "Well, I can do what it comes in wins, because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
So this is how I decided to keep it over.
So my group and I, <unk> Green <unk> we get together and we started planting our food forest, trees, <unk> you know, the nine full vegetables.
What we do is, we are a kind of paid paid <unk> made by gardeners of all the <unk> of all the city and completely volunteer, and everything we do is free.
And the garden, was beautiful.
Then somebody is <unk>
The city is <unk> and in short, they gave me a <unk> saying that I had to remove my own garden, the <unk> was made <unk>
And I said, "Come on it?
An order of <unk> for planting food on a piece of land that nobody <unk>  So I was like, "Well, <unk>
Because this time wasn't going to happen.
L.A. Times had written by Steve <unk> and talked to the <unk> and one of the <unk> <unk> who put a petition in <unk> with 900 <unk> and we were successful.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called me to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, why isn't it?
L.A. is the American city with more <unk>
It's <unk> <unk>
That's 20 to 20 Central <unk>
That's enough space to plant <unk> million plants.
Why on Earth does it not look like this?
<unk> a plant will give a <unk> 10,000 seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> I'll give you 75 dollars a result.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, cultivate your own food.
<unk> your own food is like print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for South <unk>
I grew up there, <unk> my children there.
I was excited to be part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for me for others, and I'm going to manufacture my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I grew up my art.
Such a <unk> artist that <unk> walls, I <unk> <unk>
I use the garden, like a bit of canvas, and plants and trees, are my <unk> of that canvas.
You can see what the Earth can do. If they stop their canvas.
You just can't imagine how amazing it is a <unk> and how it affects people.
What happened?
I'm witness to how my garden became an education tool of my neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the earth.
We are the land.
You want to see how it affects the kids.
<unk> is the most <unk> act that you can do, especially in a <unk>
They get <unk>
And I remember one time, which came a mother and his daughter, were like the <unk> of the night and were in my backyard, salt and watched very <unk>
I, like, man, I felt bad that they were there, and I told you, you know, you don't have to do this.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame to see people that I was so close to me with hungry, and this just reinforces why I do this, people ask me, "You don't urge people to go steal your <unk>
Which I say, "My God, I am not afraid you go to <unk>
That's the street.
That's what it's about.
I want the <unk> but at the time, I want you to get your <unk>
There was another occasion that I put a garden in a <unk> shelter in the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, who helped me download the truck.
It was great, they shared his stories about how this had affected and how they used to plant her mom and his grandmother, and it was great to see how this changed, and it was just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've had, like about 50 people who come, work and <unk> all on a volunteer plan.
If kids are growing up, they are going to eat them <unk>
If you grow <unk> you will eat <unk>  But if none of it are <unk> if you don't teach them how food affects your mind and body, they eat blind what they put them in front of them.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing that they are standing, I see color kids who are on this path for them, which doesn't take them nowhere.
With the <unk> I see an opportunity that we can train these guys who were <unk> from their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe the next George Washington, <unk>
But if we don't change the <unk> we never do.
Now this is one of my plans -- this is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block of gardens, where people can share food in the same block.
I want to take containers and turn them into <unk>
I don't care about it.
I'm not talking about free, because free is not sustainable.
The funny thing about sustainability, is you have to <unk>
So what I'm talking about is to get people to work to people, getting kids out of the street who know the joy, the pride and the honor of growing their own food, opening markets from farmers.
What I want to do here, we need to make it sexy.
I want everyone to become <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We need to change the script of what's a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
<unk> take your <unk> OK?
That is his weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, you know, if you want to see me, you don't call me if you want to sit in a comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about doing some <unk> to talk about doing some shit.
If you want to see me, come to the garden with your <unk> so that we can plant something.
Peace Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  You probably will all agree with me that this is a very <unk>
It's made of <unk> and the asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially in days as today, that it rains a lot.
You can have a huge amount of water in the asphalt that we <unk>
And especially if you go on your bike and these cars go by, that's not very nice.
In addition, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a loud material, and if we build roads like in the Netherlands, very close to cities, we would want a quiet road on the world.
The solution for that is to do <unk> roads.
The asphalt is a material that we use now in most of the roads in the Netherlands, and it has pores and water can go through it, so all the rain water will flow up the sides and have a road that is easy to drive, and they don't get water never more.
Noise also goes into these <unk>
Because it's very open, all the noise -- so it's a very silent road <unk>
It also has <unk> of course, and the downside of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> Look at this road on the surface of the surface <unk>
First of all, then a bunch of more and more and more, and so forth, and you can do that.  But you can harm your <unk> and won't be happy with that.
And finally, this can also lead to more and more damage.
Sometimes they can create holes with that.
<unk> You're ready.
You know, of course, you can become a problem, but we have a solution.
So here you can actually see how damage comes into this material.
It's a asphalt <unk> as I said, so it only has a little bit of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> to the light of light -- this <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> <unk> and if they are <unk> they will be <unk> and they'll separate from the <unk>
So if you're driving down the road, you will take the <unk> as we saw it here.
To solve this problem, we think about <unk> materials.
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use wool wool from that to clean <unk> and we can cut the steel steel on very small pieces and we can mix those little bits of <unk> with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little bits of steel wool on it.
Then you need a machine, like you see here, that you use to <unk> a <unk> machine.
<unk> can heat -- especially steel, is very good at that.
So what you have to do is it is heating the steel, melt the <unk> the <unk> flow of these <unk> and the stones will go back to the surface.
Today I used a <unk> <unk> because I can't bring the great <unk> machine here onstage.
The microwave oven, is a similar system.
I put the sample that I'm going to take to see what happened.
This is the sample that comes out now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the <unk>
We tried a lot of samples there, and then the government, really saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's very interesting. We need to <unk>
So they gave us a piece of road, 400 meters away from the <unk> highway, where we had to do a <unk> <unk> to test this stuff.
So that's what we did there, you see where we were doing the test on road, and then, of course, this road road for a number of years without any damage. That's what we know about practice.
We take a lot of samples from this road and test them in the lab.
We did aging the samples, we put a lot of payload in them, the <unk> of our <unk> machine and the <unk> and we went back to it.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can tell you that we've done a material using steel fibers bringing these fibers, using the energy of <unk> to actually increase the life of the surface surface of the road, even able to double the life of the surface, actually save a lot of money with very simple tricks.
And now, of course, you are curious about this, it also works.
We still have the sample here. It's pretty hot.
In fact, it has to cool cool first before I can show you how repairability does.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yeah, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11, I remember having woken up with the sound of the <unk> in my house.
My father was listening to News <unk> in his little gray radius.
He had a great smile in his face that was unusual at those times, because the news generally <unk>
"The Taliban was <unk> she screamed my father.
I didn't know what <unk> but I could see my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a <unk> school, he said.
One morning I will never forget.
It's a real school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban were <unk> from Afghanistan and made it illegal that girls were to school.
For the next five years, I <unk> like a kid to <unk> my eldest sister that I could no longer be used out to go to a secret school to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that two could be <unk>
Every day, we took a different route so that no one could suspect where it would be.
We had to hide books in market bags so that we were shopping.
The school was in a house, more than 100 of us prepared in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in summer.
We all knew that <unk> our lives, the teacher, the students and our parents.
Instead of a week, I suddenly had a week, because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they knew of us.
We were <unk>
Did you know where it is.
We were <unk> but yet, the school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters a <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total <unk> of a remote province in Afghanistan. <unk> that his daughter, my mother, was to the school, and so his father was <unk>
But my foster mother became mastery.
This is it.
It stepped back two years ago, just to convert our home to girls and women from our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first of his family to get education.
There was no doubt that their children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> despite the risks.
For him, there was a greater risk to not educate your children.
During the years of the <unk> I remember that there were moments that I was very frustrated about our life and was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> daughter -- you can lose everything you have in life.
Can you steal your money. You can get them to leave your house for a war.
But there's one thing that will always be with you, what's here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your blood to pay your education to pay it.
So you still want to be <unk>
I'm 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that's been destroyed for decades of war.
Less than six percent of the women in my age have more than the <unk> and if my family hadn't been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself here so proud to graduate school <unk>
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, which was <unk> from his home for the courage to educate his daughters, was one of the first ones in <unk>
He didn't just get rid of my college degree, but I was also the first woman, and I am the first woman who I've been doing with the streets in Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I dream in a big, but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I'm the global <unk> <unk> a global campaign to educate women.
This is why we <unk> the first and maybe the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country in which it is still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is, I see the students in my school with the strong desire to harness the opportunity.
And I see his parents and their families who, like mine, <unk> for them, even though in front of an opposition to <unk>
As <unk> it's not his real name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month ago, he and his daughter were going on the way from <unk> to her village, and literally <unk> of being killed by a bomb on the road, for minutes.
When you get to his house, you are the phone, a voice <unk> that if he was still sending his daughter to school, they would give it to try.
<unk> now, if he <unk> he said, "but not harm the future of my daughter for his old and <unk>
What I've given to me about Afghanistan, and it's something that is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of those who <unk> there is a father who recognized the value of her daughter and it sees that success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key to our success.
In fact, they often are the first <unk> compelling future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the <unk> the girls who went to school count on <unk> remember, it was illegal.
But today, over three million girls go to the school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in the United States.
I find that Americans see the fragility of changes.
It was <unk> that these changes didn't last long after the retirement troops in the U.S.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I look at students in my school and their parents who were <unk> by them, that the <unk> I see a future <unk> and <unk>
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities -- and every day the girls in the <unk> would be <unk>
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
I've never never forgotten the words of my grandmother's who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> <unk> against him.
But you will never get a <unk> <unk>
It's almost two years since the <unk> revolution inspired by the <unk> of mass <unk> so much of the <unk> revolution like <unk>
One forces with a lot of other citizen citizens inside and outside of the country to call a day of anger and starting a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And it was <unk> it was a big revolution.
Women and young men <unk> were at the <unk> <unk> the fall of the regime, carrying <unk> of freedom, dignity and social justice.
You've shown a <unk> courage to deal with the brutal dictatorship of <unk>
You have shown a great sense of solidarity from the <unk> East, to the west, the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of brutal war, and some losses from about 50,000 thousand people -- we managed to release our country and overthrowing the <unk>
However, <unk> left a <unk> a legacy of <unk> corruption and seeds of <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure, the culture and the moral structure of society.
<unk> out of the devastation and the challenges, I've loved with a lot of other women, rebuilding civil society, <unk> a <unk> transition and fair <unk>
We found about 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the fall of <unk> About 300 in <unk>
After a period of <unk> I went back to Libya and with a unique enthusiasm I started organizing workshops about the development of capacities and <unk> skills.
With an amazing group of women we founded the <unk> of Women -- <unk> <unk> by <unk> a women's women's leaders, to advocate for the <unk> autonomy of the woman and our right of engaging in the building of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the <unk> period, an environment that was increasingly <unk> than the selfish policies of domination and <unk>
Over time, our initiative was unanimously and successful.
Women won a <unk> of the National Congress.
And yet, <unk> the <unk> of the elections, and the revolution as a whole, was <unk> every day we found news from violence.
One day we woke up with the news of the former <unk> of ancient mosques and <unk>
Another day <unk> with the news of the murder of the <unk> and the attack on <unk>
Another day we woke up with the news of the reports of the army.
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of <unk> and their <unk> human rights violations.
Our society shaped by a revolutionary mindset -- it gets away from the ideals and the principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, we had the beginning.
<unk> <unk> and vengeance became the icons of the consequences of the revolution.
I'm not here at all of you at all of us at all of us today to deal with our success story of the success of the success of the success of <unk> and the election.
I'm here today to say that we, as a nation, we chose to evil, we took the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize well.
Because the choices didn't brought in peace and stability and security to Libya.
The <unk> list, and the <unk> between <unk> and <unk> brought up peace and reconciliation, <unk>
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why is our society <unk> and dominated with selfish policies of domination and <unk> by men like by women?
Maybe what was missing was not just women, but the women's values of compassion, mercy and <unk>
Our society needs national dialogue and the creation of more than the election, which just needed the polarization and the <unk>
Our nation needs the <unk> of the females who need the <unk> and quantitative representation of it.
We need to stop acting like <unk> and call a days of anger.
We need to start acting like compassion and for mercy.
We need to develop a female speech, not just <unk> but also putting the mercy out of <unk> instead of <unk> collaboration in the competition, the inclusion rather than the <unk>
These are the ideals that a Libya, <unk> for the war, needs desperately to reach the peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about the interrelationship and the <unk> between women's <unk> and <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that in an existential way before we do it in a <unk> way.
According to an <unk> of the Koran <unk> "is the word of the God <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the time, the word <unk> which is known for all the <unk> traditions -- has the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> the <unk> and <unk> that <unk> all the tribes that men and women, that all the tribes and all the towns have <unk>
And so just like the uterus cover completely the <unk> that grows inside, the divine <unk> of compassion -- it turns out the whole existence.
So this is what he says, "My mercy is going for all the things."
So he goes, "My mercy <unk> about my <unk>
That everyone is <unk> the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a startling question that has an answer to equally <unk>
This is about the secrets.
Why would anyone stay with a man who <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, no social worker, no expert on domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to count.
I was 22 years old. He had been at Harvard University.
I had moved me to New York City as a writer and an editor in <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, and my first green <unk> American <unk> and I had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, that I believed my alma mater, <unk> my head with a <unk> <unk> with <unk> bullets with <unk>
The man who loved anyone in this world, put a gun in my head and <unk> with <unk> more than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a psychological trap <unk> of love, where you fall every year million women, and even some men.
It could even be his story.
I don't look like a typical <unk> of domestic violence.
I'm a <unk> in English at Harvard University, and I have a MBA at <unk> Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working for companies on the <unk> list, <unk> between them Johnson & Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington Washington <unk>
I've been nearly 20 years married with my second husband, and we have three kids.
My dog is a black <unk> and a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message to you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all the races, all of the religions, all the levels of income and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
Over 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and domestic abuse, only happens in <unk> and <unk> relationships and <unk> or <unk> in the families, the last place where we want or we would expect to find <unk> which is why the domestic abuse is so <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world that was sitting with a man who sticks, and actually I was a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States the women in the age of 16 and 24 years old, have three times the victims of domestic violence than the other ages, and more than 500 women and girls of that age are killed every year by partners, and <unk> and husbands in the United States.
I also got a typical victim because I knew nothing about domestic violence and your warning signals or the patterns.
I met <unk> on a cold and rainy night of January.
I was sitting next to me at the subway in New York and started <unk> with me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he was also <unk> from a college of the <unk> <unk> and working on a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what struck me in that first meeting was that it was ready and fun, and it looked like a guy in the field.
I had some big <unk> like apples, and a <unk> hair, wheat, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the smartest things that made it <unk> was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of partners.
He did it mostly in the beginning of <unk> in a <unk>
We started coming out and he loved all of me that was list, that I had gone to Harvard, that I would have a passion for helping teenage girls and my job.
I wanted to know that all about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, like anyone had done it before.
And that's why the <unk> of that <unk> and work on Wall Street and his bright future had so much important for him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> to the victim.
And I didn't know that the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was to go from New York and leave the work of my dreams, but I thought I had to do sacrifices for your spouse, so I <unk> I quit my work and <unk> and I went together in Manhattan.
I had no idea that I was falling into a <unk> <unk> that was getting out of the head of a physical, financial trap, and carefully <unk>
The next step in the heart of domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it reacts with it.
And this is where they come into the <unk>
And as soon as we moved to New England you know, that place where it was supposed to feel so <unk> I bought three <unk>
I had it in the <unk> of the car.
The other one he kept underneath the pillow in our bed, and the third always in his pocket.
And he said I needed these guns because of the trauma that lived in a small basis.
I needed them to feel secure.
But these <unk> actually were a message for me, and even though I had never gotten off my hand, my life was already serious about every minute of every day.
The first physical attack on <unk> came five days before our wedding.
They were seven in the morning and I still had the <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises of my neck had disappeared, I put the girlfriend of my mother and married him with him.
Despite what had happened, I was sure that we were living happily ever forever, because I loved him and he was also so much.
And I was very, very <unk>
There was just very <unk> for the wedding and the fact that they form a family with me.
He had been a isolated accident, and I would never hurt it more than the <unk>
I spent twice the moon of honey.
The first time I was driving into a secret beach and <unk> and he gave me so hard in the head that we <unk> several times against the <unk> of the car.
And then, a couple days later, driving back from our honey. of honey. It was <unk> by traffic and threw me a Big Mac cold to the face.
<unk> kept <unk> one or twice a week for the next two years and a half years of our marriage.
I was <unk> when I thought it was the only thing in this situation.
One of three American women is a victim of domestic violence or <unk> at some point in their life, and the Centers for Disease Control reports that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So, actually, I had very good company.
To go back to my question: Why do I <unk>
The answer is straightforward.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
On the contrary, I was a very strong woman, in love with a profoundly <unk> man, and it was the only person in the world who could help <unk> to face their <unk>
The other question that everybody else does is: Why don't you just <unk>
Why didn't I <unk> I could have been at any time.
For me, this is the saddest and painful question that people do, because we all the victims, we know something that you usually have to do, is incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase in the heart of domestic violence is <unk>
More than 70 percent of the killings in cases of domestic violence happen after the victim has put the end up to the relationship, after <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other repercussions include permanent <unk> even after the <unk> has gone back to married, <unk> of financial resources, and manipulation of the family judicial system to support the victim and their children, who are usually forced for judges to spend time not <unk> with the man who <unk> their mother.
And we're still asking why we are just asking why it's simply not moving.
I was able to go, because of one last <unk> to beat my denial.
I realized that the man who loved so much, he would have killed me if he had been allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told the entire world to the <unk> to the police, my neighbors, my friends and family friends to complete strangers, and I'm here today because all of you are telling me.
We have the tendency to <unk> victims as <unk> women, women -- <unk> goods.
The question, "Why do you <unk>
For some people it is a way of saying <unk> as if the victims of the <unk> <unk> <unk> men who want to <unk>
But since I posted <unk> I have heard hundreds of stories of men and women who have also learned a <unk> lesson from what happened to them, and that <unk> their lives joyful and happy to be <unk> wives and mothers, completely free of violence like mine.
Because it turns out that actually I'm a victim and a survivor of domestic domestic violence.
I went back to marry a nice man and kind and have those three kids.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm going to go back to you is ever going to have ever more, ever, is a <unk> gun pointing into my head in the hands of someone who says that I will.
At this moment, just like you're thinking, <unk> that's <unk> or <unk> what stupid <unk> but all this time I have ever been talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people who are listening to me right now, who are listening to me right now, who are being <unk> or that they were <unk> or they're <unk> themselves.
The <unk> could be affecting his daughter, his sister, his best friend right now.
I was able to end my mad love, a particular <unk> of silence.
And I'm still doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last appeal to you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
<unk> itself in silence.
They have the power to end domestic violence simply shedding light on it.
The victims we need all over the world.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
They put the <unk> to light talking about it with their kids, their job and family friends.
<unk> their vision of survivors like fantastic people and <unk> that have a <unk> future.
He <unk> the early signs of violence to intervene consciously, to slow down his climb and show the victims a safe <unk>
And together we can turn our beds, our tables and our families in the <unk> and <unk> that they should be.
Thank you.
Hello. I call myself Cameron <unk> and for a while, I am model.
To be precise, for 10 years ago.
And I feel that at this point, there is a awkward tension in the room because I should not have dressed it like this.  So I've brought it clothes for <unk>
This is the first pair of clothes on a <unk> scenario, so you have a lot of <unk> I think.
If some of the women are <unk> when some of the women are <unk> they don't have to <unk> but find it later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think about me as only 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These <unk> are very <unk> less bad than I don't have to use.
The worst part is to spend this sweater on your head, because it's when you're going to make fun of me, so they don't do anything while I cover your mind.
All right.
Why did I do this?
It has been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
<unk> is powerful, but also <unk>
I've changed totally what they thought about me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I had never had a <unk> in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable and the photographer would tell me that he <unk> the back and <unk> the <unk> hair.
Of course, except with surgery or a artificial <unk> like that I made it two days ago for work, there is very little to be able to do to transform how we look like, which, even the superficial and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, to me, being brave does it mean to be honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
Because I'm a nice, white woman, and in my workforce, that's being a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but <unk>
The first question is, how do you get to be model?
And I always say, <unk> <unk> I was discovered, but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made a model is because I won the genetic lottery. And I'm the <unk> of an <unk> and maybe you're wondering what this <unk> is.
Well, in the last centuries we have not only defined beauty as youth and youth and symmetry, which are biologically programmed for <unk> we have also associated with a high and <unk> shape, and a white skin.
And that's my <unk> <unk> that I've known to take to make money.
And I know that there are people in the audience who are now shown <unk> and maybe there are some <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> there are Joan <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
First of all, the <unk> to know so much of models. It's amazing.
But unfortunately, I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at the University of New York told each and every one of the models in the <unk> and from the <unk> models, <unk> models, only about four percent, were not white <unk>
The next question that people always ask is, can it be a model when you <unk>
And my first answer is: I don't know, I don't care about that.
But then, what I would actually tell each one of these girls is: Why? Can you be what you want.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a surgeon <unk> ninja and poet, which would be awesome, because you are the first.
If after this list, there is still <unk> No, no, Cameron, I want to be model, so I tell you, I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of nothing, and you could be the head of the American magazine magazine or the <unk> executive director, or the next Steven <unk>
So to say that you want to be a model of what you say you want to win the lottery.
It's out of your control, it's amazing, and it's not a work you can choose.
I'm going to prove to you everything I learned in 10 years as a model, because unlike <unk> surgery, can be summed up right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you have your studies, your studies, and you have a <unk> and a few jobs on your back, no matter what you might think of, if you want to be the president that you want to be the United States of the United States, but your test <unk> for 10 years, people would look <unk>
The next question that people always do is if all the photos are <unk>
And yes, virtually the pictures, but that's just a little bit of what happens.
This was the first picture that I was <unk> and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my <unk>
I know we're entering the personal space, but it was a little girl.
So he was looking at my grandmother a few months earlier.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am at a <unk> party.
Here I am with my football team, and at <unk>
And this is me today.
And I hope you'll realize that I'm not me in those photos.
They are <unk> of a group of professional professionals, <unk> <unk> photographers and <unk> and all their <unk> and people of <unk> and they get to create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always ask is, <unk> things for free?
I have too many <unk> heels.
I grew up in Cambridge, and I once went to a store and I forgot to get money, and they gave me the <unk> for free.
When I was a teenager, I was going to travel with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> he went a red light and of course, <unk> and <unk> a sorry, agent in order to keep <unk>
So let's get rid of these privileges for me, and I would look like, not because of what I am. And there are people who are paying for a price for their appearance, no matter who they are.
I live in New York, and last year, from the <unk> teenagers who were pair and <unk> <unk> were black and <unk> and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> young black and Latino men in New York City, by what for them, it's not a question of <unk>
It is how many times I get <unk>
By doing this talk, I learned that to 53 percent of the girls in the United States <unk> they don't like their body, and that figure comes up to the 78 percent to the 17.
So the last question that people ask me is: What is the life of a model?
And I think the answer that you expect is: If you're a little bit thinner and you have the smartest hair, you'll feel very happy and beautiful.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe you get it out.
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and also incredible to work with creative people, clever people.
And all of that is true, but it's just a part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, what I never said in front of them, is: I'm insecure.
And I am because I have to worry about my way every day.
And if you ever ask, with some stronger legs and the more brilliant hair, it will be happier?
They only have to meet with a group of models, because they have the most bright legs and the <unk> and the <unk> but probably the <unk> <unk> of the planet.
But especially it was hard to look at a situation of racial oppression and gender and gender as I am one of the greatest <unk>
If there is something to retain from this talk, I hope that everybody will feel more comfortable in recognizing the power of the image in the perception of the success of success and failure.
Thank you.
Photography has been my passion since I was the big enough to hold a camera, but today I want to share with you my 15 pictures more <unk> and I didn't get the <unk>
There was no <unk> or no <unk> no opportunity to repeat the photos, not even quite a little bit of care.
In fact, most of them took them tourists randomly.
My story starts when I was in New York City to give a <unk> my wife took me this photo holding my daughter on the day of his first birthday. That is the corner of 57 and <unk>
And he took the chance we went back to New York just a year later, so we decided to pull the same shot.
Well, you can imagine what comes right now.
When I was approaching the third birthday of my daughter, my wife told me, why don't you take yourself to New York at a <unk> journey, and you continue to <unk>
So here is when we started to ask for the tourists they were going to get out of the photo.
It's amazing that the gesture of giving the camera to a complete stranger is so universal.
No one has ever been denied and, fortunately, no one has <unk> it with the camera.
So we weren't aware of how much life would change that journey.
It became something sacred for us.
This photo is a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day as a five year-old girl could understand.
These pictures are much more than a particular moment or a specific journey.
They're also a way of stopping the time on a week of October and to make us reflect on our age and our evolution over the years, and not only at the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because, even though we always put the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter reaches new <unk> and I can see life through his eyes and how you perceive and interact with everything.
That time in concrete that we spent together is something that we hope for the entire year.
So recently, in one of travel, we were walking out of it, when all of a sudden he stopped in dry and pointed out a red <unk> of the <unk> store that <unk> from little ones in some previous <unk>
And I described to me what it was about five years of foot in that same place.
<unk> who remembered his heart <unk> with force to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what you see in New York are universities, because they're determined to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things we created is memories.
So I want to share the idea of actively engaging in the conscious creation of memories.
I don't know about you, but apart from these 15 pictures, I don't get out of a lot of the family pictures.
I'm always the one who takes the photo.
So today, I want to encourage you all to come up in the picture, and I don't want to go around somebody and asked him, and you get out a <unk>
Thank you.
I'd like to talk about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are in the most <unk> birds.
First of all, why do they have so bad <unk>
It's also associated with Disney <unk> like <unk> silly characters.
More recently, if you have been following the press and applause and applause and applause and <unk> these are the attributes that associated with Parliament <unk> but I don't accept it.
I don't accept it. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament are not clean the environment.  <unk> don't help prevent the spread of disease.
<unk> are <unk>   You're far from <unk>  And my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.   There are two types of <unk> on this planet.
There are the <unk> of the New World that are largely in <unk> like <unk> and <unk> and the <unk> of the World <unk> where we have 16 species of extinction.
So why is the <unk> they are important -- first of all, they provide vital services ecological services.
They're our <unk> of natural <unk>
They <unk> people all go to bone.
They help kill all the bacteria. They help absorb the anthrax that not be for them would spread and caused large losses of livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent surveys have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> the people will take three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge ramifications in the spread of disease.
<unk> also have enormous important importance.
They've been associated with the ancient <unk> culture.
<unk> was the symbol of lip and maternity and, along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between the <unk> and the beneath Egypt.
In the mythology of <unk> <unk> was the god <unk> and risked his life to save the <unk> goddess of the Tasmanian devil <unk>
In <unk> culture, they are doing very important <unk> in places like Tibet, there is no place to bury the dead, or wood to <unk> so these <unk> provide a natural <unk> system.
What's the problem with <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, which six are at extreme <unk>
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason they are being <unk> is because there are conflict between humans and <unk> communities use this venom against predators, and as a result, the <unk> are victims of this.
In southern Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are on the critically critical list of extinction, -- what it means that in less than 10 or 15 years ago, and the reason is because they put prey from livestock to livestock that has been treated with a <unk> <unk>
This drug has been banned for vet in India and have taken a posture.
Because there is no <unk> there have been a spread in the number of dogs in <unk> and when you have <unk> dogs <unk> you have a huge amount of time bomb, and the number of cases of rage has increased enormously in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the largest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be the top of the lake.
I'm not against wind energy, but we have to work with governments, because the wind turbines do this to the birds.
They're <unk> of birds.
In West Africa, there's a horrible trade of <unk> to serve the <unk> and the <unk> market.
So what are you doing? Well, we're researching these birds. We're <unk> <unk>
We're trying to determine their basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel for different countries, so to focus on a grassroots problem -- it's not going to be at all.
We need to work with governments in the <unk>
We're working with local communities.
So we're talking to them about appreciate the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and services that we <unk>
How can you help? It can become assets, make noise.
When you get out of this room, you will tell you about the <unk> but talk to your families, with their kids, with your neighbors on the <unk>
They're very <unk> Charles Darwin said it changed because he saw it <unk> without the energy spending in the heavens.
Kenya, this world, will be much poorest without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every thing I do and everything I do -- my life has been <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to <unk> <unk> young people, but I am not who I am.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, Costa <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for an NGO <unk> and every project that we developed in sub-Saharan Africa.
And I was <unk>
I went to 21, that Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of that, everything else is going to be <unk>
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> from the <unk> was a project where some Italians decided to teach people in country to grow food.
So we came to the seeds of <unk> the south of Zambia to this absolutely magnificent valley that goes down to the <unk> River.
And of course, people were not at all interested in doing that, so they <unk> them to come to work, and sometimes they did not <unk>  We were quite interested in that local <unk> were not had agriculture.
And yet, instead of asking you how it was possible that we didn't understand anything, we just said, "Thank God we are here."  <unk> time to save the people in the <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa was grown <unk>
We got these <unk> <unk> in Italy, a tomato would grow to this size.
And we couldn't believe it, we were saying to the <unk> "Look at the <unk>
When tomatoes were beautiful, <unk> and red, from the night to the morning, about 200 <unk> appeared from the river and ate everything.  And we said to the <unk> "Oh my God, the <unk>
And the <unk> said, "Yes, that's why we don't have agriculture here."  "Why don't you <unk> "You're never <unk>
I thought only of us Italians <unk> errors in Africa, but then I saw what Americans, what they did -- what the English people were doing and after seeing what they were doing, I was quite proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, as you see, at least we feed the <unk>
You can see the <unk>   So let's see the waste that we gave them to the <unk> people from Africa.
She wants to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, the Western continent have given the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you about the damage that that money has <unk>
Just read your book.
<unk> from an African woman, the harm that we've done.
Westerners are <unk> missionaries -- and we treat people only two things: or <unk> or we're <unk>
The two words come from the root <unk> <unk> which means <unk>
But they mean two different things.
<unk> I try to deal with any of a different culture like my kids, "I want a lot."
<unk> I try to deal with all of a different culture like my <unk>
So white in Africa are called <unk> boss.
That book gave me a slap in the face. <unk> is <unk> written by <unk> who said for all economic development, if people don't want to be <unk> <unk> alone.
This should be the first principle of help.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the gentleman who opened this conference put a stick on the ground and said, we can -- you can imagine a city that is not <unk>
I decided to just answer the people, and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start nothing, you ever get anyone, but it becomes a <unk> of the local passion, the <unk> of the local people who have the dream of becoming a better person.
So what does it do? It is <unk>
It will never reach a community with an idea, and sit with the people of the <unk>
We don't work from the offices.
We met in a <unk> we met in a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is the passion.
You can give you an idea to someone.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what is going to do you?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that that man has for its own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then we help you find the knowledge because no one in the world can be successful.
The person with the idea may not have knowledge but knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why not us, for once instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why not do it for a time, but not in <unk>
Let me tell you a secret.
There's a problem with the <unk>
The entrepreneurs never <unk> and they never will say, in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what opportunity have been <unk>
So the planning has this blind point.
The most intelligent people in their community, you don't even know the known, because they don't go to their public meetings.
What do we do? We work one to you, and we work face to face, you have to create a social infrastructure.
You must create a new <unk>
The profession is the family doctor of the company, the family doctor who is made up with you at your house, at the kitchen table in the coffee, and that helps you find the resources to transform your passion in a way of a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city in Western Africa.
I was doing a Ph.D. at that time, trying to get away from this <unk> trash that we came to tell you what to do.
Within a year, I had 27 projects going on, and the government came to me to see how you can do that?
How do you do it?" And I said, "I did something really, really, really hard.
And so I was <unk>   So the government says, <unk> <unk>  We've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We have helped to start 40,000 businesses.
There is a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the greatest business advisers in history, passed away to '96, '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor of philosophy before getting involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> is actually incompatible with a society and a <unk> economy.
<unk> is the kiss of the death of the <unk>
So now <unk> rebuilding <unk> without knowing what the most <unk> people in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to come to talk with you.
You have to offer you -- privacy, it has to be fantastic for the <unk> and then you have to come up, they will come in mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
What talk do you have <unk> more this tomorrow?
<unk> <unk> That's what you have <unk>
So what I tell you is that the entrepreneurial spirit is where it is.
We're at the end of the first <unk> industrial revolution -- fossils not renewable <unk> and one moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way of holding <unk> is not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is how we <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There are no technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution -- <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>
They will be entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's a wonderful story that was in a <unk> magazine many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in the <unk>
And in the year <unk> there was this group of people. And <unk> about what would happen to the city of New York in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> the city of New York would not exist within 100 years.
Why? Because they looked at the curve and <unk> if the population is growing up to this <unk> to move the population of New York to the <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the manure produced for six million horses would be impossible to address.
They were already <unk> in dung.  So in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that <unk> the life of New York City.
So what happens? In the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States showed up, generic generic companies <unk>
And the idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there was very few factories in <unk>
<unk> Michigan. Henry Ford <unk>
But there's a secret to work with the entrepreneurs.
First, you have to offer you <unk>
Otherwise, they won't come to talk with you.
Then, you have to offer you an absolute dedicated <unk>
And then you have to tell you the truth about <unk>
The smaller company, the largest company, it has to be able to do three things: the product that you want to sell has to be fantastic, you have to tell you with a fantastic marketing -- you have to tell you with a great financial <unk>
Guess what?
We have never met a single human being in the world that can make, sell and find the money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is still not born.
We've looked and looked at the 100 iconic companies in the Carnegie world, <unk> <unk> Ford, all the new companies, Google <unk>
There is only one thing that all the successful companies in the world have in common, only one, no one was started by one person.
I would never have the word <unk> but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when it started.
No one starts a company alone.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who came from a small business environment on coffee <unk> together with their dedicated comrades who will do for you, what someone did for this <unk> who is talking about this <unk> somebody who asked you, what do you need?
What can you? Can you do that?
Well, you can <unk> it can look for the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that." I mean, I want you to <unk>
We activate communities.
Thank you.
Those of us can help us from many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't know a lot of knowledge in spite of sharing the same public spaces.
Over the last few years, I've tried to share more with my neighbors in the public space, with simple tools like <unk> <unk> and chalk.
These projects came from questions like, how much pay my neighbors for their <unk>
How can we pay and borrow more things without calling the door for a bad moment?
How do you share more memories of our abandoned buildings and better understand our <unk>
How do you share more our hopes for empty stores for our communities to reflect our needs and <unk>
I live in New York, and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with the giant <unk> that give shadows to <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries and I trust a city.
It always gives the music to the music.  There's a <unk> <unk>  The city has one of the most beautiful architectures in the world, but also one with the largest number of abandoned housing properties.
I live near this house and thought how it could turn it into a more nice space for the neighborhood and also something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone who loved a lot.
It was <unk> as a mother for <unk>
Her death was sudden and unexpected.
I thought a lot about death and <unk>
And it made me a deep gratitude for the living time.
He gave it clarity to the significant things about my life today.
But let's get it to keep this look in my daily lives.
It seems to me that it's easy to be able to catch on the day and forget the really important thing for you.
So with the help of old and new friends transformed the wall of this abandoned house on a giant <unk> and painted over her phrases to <unk> "Before he die <unk>
So <unk> could take a <unk> to reflect on their lives and share personal aspirations in public space.
I didn't know what to wait for this experiment, but the next day the wall was filled and still <unk>
And I would like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before I died, I want to be <unk> for <unk>  "Before I died, I want to sit on the <unk> line of <unk>
He moved out to die for millions of people."
He moved out, I want to plant a <unk>
He moved out to die out of the <unk>
He moved forward to <unk> once longer."
He moved out, I want to go to the Treasure rescue.
Before I died, I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space became <unk> and the dreams and the hopes of people made me laugh at <unk> and they gave me comfort in difficult times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new ways and <unk> it is about giving us the reflection and the <unk> and to remember what the most important thing is for us as we grow and <unk>
This happened last year and I started receiving hundreds of messages of passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
So with my colleagues in the heart of civic center, we did a kit and now have made mass walls across the world, like <unk> South Africa, Australia, Argentina and beyond.
And together we show the power of our public spaces if you give us the opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things that we have is time and our relationships with other people.
And in our era of fossil <unk> it's more important than ever, finding ways to conserving the perspective and remember that life is very <unk>
The death is something that we often avoid to talk about, or even think, but I understood that we need to prepare for death is one of those things that we get more power.
And if you think about death <unk> our life.
Our shared spaces can reflect better what we care about as individuals and as community and more means and more means to share hope and stories, the people around us, cannot only help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a only request today.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my siblings.
<unk> is 22 and very <unk>
I don't talk, but transmitting joy better than some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what love.
It's shared. <unk> happen what happens.
It's not <unk> It doesn't look at the color color.
It doesn't care about religious differences, and notice this thing is never <unk>
When singing songs of our childhood, I tried to say words that I didn't even know, I think it reminds me of one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful it must be the unknown.
Samuel is 16 years old. It's very hot.
<unk> the most <unk> memory.
However, it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remind me of my <unk> but it remembers the year I came out every one of the songs of my iPod, conversations that we kept when I was four years old, I pee on my arm during the first episode of the <unk> and the Lady of Lady <unk>
It doesn't seem <unk>
But most people don't.
And in fact, because your minds do not fit into the concept of normal society, often are <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled me to my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, even though we wouldn't consider it within the <unk> that could only mean one thing -- which was <unk> autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for those less familiar with the term <unk> is a complex brain disorder that affects social media, and sometimes the physical skills.
In each individual it is <unk> in a different way, from there that <unk> is so different to Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, being diagnosed with autism, and even though it's one of the developmental disorders that faster in the world is increasing in the world, there is no cause for any cure for any <unk>
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without him.
I was only three years old when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited about having a new way to be in my life.
When I was a few months, I realized he was different.
Thank you very much.
I didn't want to play like the other babies -- and in fact, it didn't seem very interested in me at all.
He lived in his own world, and he was living in his own world, with his own rules, and I would find pleasure in the smallest things, like putting cars in row around the room, looking at the washing machine and eating anything that would be <unk>
As I was growing up, it became more different, and the differences became more apparent.
But beyond the <unk> the frustration and the <unk> <unk> there was something really <unk> a pure and innocent nature, a child who saw the world without <unk> a human being that had never been <unk>
<unk>
I can't deny that there have been some difficult moments in my family, moments I wish that they were just like me.
But I look back at the things that have taught me about individuality, and communication and love, and I realize that they are things that wouldn't want to change in normal.
The <unk> passes the beauty that gives us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that any of you are wrong.
It just means that there is a different vision of what is right.
If I could put it one thing to <unk> and Sam and to you, would be that you don't have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because, they are or not, the differences that you <unk> are a <unk> Each of us has a gift on your guts and, honestly, the pursuit of normal, is the last sacrifice of the potential.
The opportunity for the <unk> the progress and the change in the moment that we try to be like others.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit of what must have been <unk> in the country of <unk>
Penn State asked me a professor of communications, giving a kind of communication to graduate engineering.
I was scared.  <unk> indeed.
But as those conversations -- I felt what <unk> must have felt when he fell through the <unk> hole and saw the door of a new world.
I just sat down when I had these conversations with the students, I was shocked by the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to open that door is a great communication.
We desperately need a great communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones who are attacking our largest challenges from power to environment and health care, between others, and if we don't know how to understand this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as not scientists to have these interactions.
But these big conversations cannot happen if our scientists and engineers are not invited to see their world as well.
So scientists and engineers, please do it with <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do to make sure that your science is sexy and your engineering is attractive.
First question for <unk> and then what?
<unk> why science is relevant to us.
You don't tell us that they study the <unk> but study the <unk> that are the <unk> structure of our bones because it's important to understand and try and try <unk>
And when you're describing your science, carefully <unk>
<unk> is an obstacle to our understanding of their ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why not say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> accessible is not the same thing.
Instead, as Einstein said, it's all as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can communicate clearly their science without engaging the ideas.
One of the things to consider is using examples, and stories and <unk> are ways of hook and <unk> with their content.
And when I present their work, forget the signs of <unk>
Have you wondered why they're called <unk> and what do they do <unk> bullets kill them, and they <unk> their presentation.
A <unk> like this is not only boring, but it's being supported in the area of our brain and <unk> us.
Instead, this <unk> of example of <unk> Brown is much more effective, it shows that the special structure of <unk> is so strong that it really inspired the only design of the <unk> <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple phrase, <unk> that the audience can understand if you lose a little bit, and then give you a little bit later -- and then give you a little bit more profound sense of understanding what they <unk>
I think these are just some key that can help the other open and see the country of the wonders that is science and engineering.
And so scientists and engineers, when you solved this equation, by all the media, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from all the <unk> <unk> is <unk>
Just because it sounds very good.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Although there was an editor in the 19th century that was defined by a lot better when he said, "A <unk> is the ones that look for a public <unk> no matter whether -- platform or <unk> and that, when he wins, you get it by the mere use of a monumental <unk> <unk>
I have no idea what it means <unk>
One thing to do with words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis in politics, and that all politicians know that they have to try and master language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, that the British Parliament allowed the newspapers, to quote the exact words that were told in the <unk> camera.
And all of this was because of the courage of a guy with the rare name of <unk> <unk> who faced <unk>
They put him on the <unk> Tower, and he <unk> but he had enough courage to deal with them, and at the end, he had such a popular support in London that won.
And only a few years later, we had the first use of the phrase <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> like <unk>
Most people think it's <unk>
It's not. It's for a freedom of freedom of expression.
But to show you really how words and politics interact, I want you to go back to the U.S., just after independence.
So they had to deal with the question of how to call George Washington, his leader.
You didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a <unk> country.
This is <unk> in Congress for a long time.
They got all kinds of suggestions you could have <unk>
Some people wanted to call it the <unk> <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> from the <unk> of the <unk> <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some of them just wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was tried to do quality.
And it wasn't even <unk> they had the idea that you could be chosen for a fixed <unk>
And I could have <unk>
All the world got tired of all, because this debate was <unk> for three weeks.
I read the daily <unk> of a poor <unk> and I would always be <unk> with this <unk>
What caused the <unk> and <unk> was that the House of Representatives were against the <unk>
The House of Representatives didn't want me to be <unk> of power.
They didn't want to call it King if he would give him or his designated ideas.
So they wanted to give the oldest title and more <unk> and more <unk> that they came up with.
And that title was <unk>
President. I didn't even invented the title. But it just meant <unk> that <unk> a <unk>
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have much more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There was <unk> of little <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk> but it was really a <unk>
And that's why the Senate <unk>
They said, "is ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign treaties and meet with <unk> <unk>
"And who's going to take a degree with a <unk> and baby as President of <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate doesn't exist.
We can learn three interesting things of all this.
First of all, and this is my favorite to where I've been able to figure out, the Senate has never been <unk> for the President's degree.
President Barack Obama is very lucky to keep out there, waiting for the Senate to be in the action.
The second thing that we can learn is that when a government says that one measure is <unk>  <unk> possible to be waiting for <unk> years.
But the third thing that we can learn, and this is the most important thing, and this is the title of President of the United States doesn't sound at all so modest today, right?
And especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear warheads at all; the greatest economy of the world and a fleet of air vehicles and so on.
The reality and the story has else?
So at the end, I won the <unk>
They got their title of <unk>
And also the other concern of the Senate, the appearance of <unk> -- well, it was a <unk> then.
But you know how many nations have now <unk>
And all because they want to sound like the 5,000 nuclear <unk> and so on.
So, at the end the Senate won and the House of Representatives <unk> because no one is going to feel humble when you tell them that they're now the President of <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson that we can learn, and that I would like to <unk>
The politicians are trying to choose and use the words to shape and control reality, but actually the fact changes a lot more the words than what they might change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 to meters underground in an illegal mine.
The air is <unk> and dust <unk> and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the <unk> of <unk> bodies in the dark, but I can't see it much more.
I hear voices that talk about it, but most of all, that cacophony of <unk> male and stones and stones and stones and <unk>
Like the other, I carry a cheap firefly <unk> <unk> to the head with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely distinguish the <unk> branches that hold the walls of that hole in a meter that drops hundreds of meters on the ground.
It was <unk> my hand and suddenly I remember a <unk> I met a <unk> and he lost <unk> feet on that <unk>
As I talk to you today, these guys are at the deep way at that hole at risk their lives without paying no progress, and often, dying.
I went out of that hole and I went home but they may never do it, because they're prey to slavery.
In the last 28 years, I was documenting native cultures in more than 70 countries in six continents, and in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only <unk> in the <unk> <unk>
Among all the amazing people I met there I met a <unk> <unk> the <unk> an NGO who has been to eradicate modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and really, I started learning about slavery because I knew that there was in the world, but not a <unk>
When we ended up talking to me that I was very sad, I honestly had to ignore this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
He made me a <unk> and weeks later, I flew to Los Angeles to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
So I started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I had been in many of these places.
Some people would even consider my second home.
But this time, <unk> the dirty <unk>
A conservative calculation says that there is more than 27 million people <unk> in the world.
It's twice as much as the number of Africans displaced throughout the <unk> slave <unk>
150 years ago, the cost of a farmer slave was about three times the annual salary of a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of about 50,000 dollars today.
However, we can risk entire families for generations for <unk> <unk>
<unk> slavery generates profits from over 13 billion dollars a year around the world.
Many of them have been <unk> with false promises of good education and better work for then to find out that they are forced to work without pay, under a threat of violence and cannot escape.
Today, slavery is operating in <unk> goods produced for slaves have value, but those who produce them are <unk>
<unk> exists in almost the world and yet it's illegal around the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the bricks.
This strange show and <unk> was like entering the old Egypt or the <unk> of <unk>
It <unk> on a temperature of 54 degrees C, men, women, kids, in fact, entire families -- <unk> in a heavy canopy <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> brick <unk> in their heads to 18 at the same time, and the <unk> <unk>
<unk> by <unk> and <unk> work in silence, doing this task over and over over 16 -- 17 hours a day.
There was no <unk> to eat, not to drink, and the severe <unk> made that pee pretty <unk>
So <unk> were the heat and the dust that my camera was turned too hot to the touch and stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean the team and make it work with air conditioning to go, and sitting there, I was thinking, like, my camera gets a much better treatment than these people.
Back in <unk> I wanted to cry but the <unk> that I was on my side quickly grabbed me and said, <unk> don't do it here."
And he explained very clearly that demonstrate emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not only for me but for them.
I couldn't offer you any direct aid.
I couldn't give them money, nothing.
I was not civil for that country.
I could put them in a worse situation that they were already gone.
I had to rely on <unk> the <unk> and work within the system for his liberation and he trusted him that he <unk>
As soon as I waited to get home to feel my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas I found children <unk> <unk> for miles per mile per mile down to the <unk>
Those big <unk> were more heavy than the kids than the <unk> and the children would <unk> their heads with <unk> made of <unk> <unk> and <unk>
It's hard to see something so <unk>
How can we influence something so <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know that they are slaves -- and they work 16 -- 17 hours a day without <unk> because this is all their life.
They have nothing with which <unk>
When these villagers <unk> his freedom, the <unk> had completely <unk> their homes.
When you hear the word <unk> we often think of sexual trafficking, and because of the global consciousness they advised me to be hard for me to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> I was <unk> women who had been previously <unk> sex.
I was led to some <unk> <unk> that would give this <unk> <unk> <unk>
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was a restaurant.
<unk> as you know in the craft, they're local for <unk>
They have small, private rooms where the <unk> <unk> with their girls and children, some of them just seven years -- they're forced to meet clients and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Every place is dark and <unk> identified by a number of painted on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse with their clients.
On the <unk> I remember the sense of a <unk> <unk> and in that moment, I could barely imagine what it should be stuck in that <unk>
I just had a <unk> the stairs where they <unk>
There was no <unk>
There was no big windows.
Those people don't have <unk> and because we touch a topic, it's important to point out that slavery even sex -- even the sexual trafficking, it happens around us.
There are hundreds of people <unk> in agriculture, in <unk> in domestic service, and the list can continue.
Recently, The New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 children are sold every year as sex slaves every year.
It's everywhere, but we don't see it.
<unk> are another activity that often associate with labor labor.
I went to Indian villages, where there were whole families <unk> in the trade.
This is a family.
<unk> hands are the father, blue <unk> and red, of their children.
<unk> <unk> in these great barrels and <unk> silk on the liquid to the <unk> but the <unk> is <unk>
My translator told me his stories.
"We don't have <unk> they said.
We still hope, yet we can get out of this house someday and go to another place where we really pay our job."
It's estimated that there are more than 4,000 children in <unk> in Lake <unk> the largest artificial lake in the world.
When we arrived, I went to take a quick look fast.
I saw what seemed to be an fishermen family, on a boat, two older <unk> -- some younger kids, make sense isn't it?
<unk> They were all slaves.
Kids are separated from their <unk> families, <unk> and forced to work <unk> in these boats in the lake, despite not knowing swimming.
This child is eight years old.
When our boat came up to me was <unk> that his little canoe was <unk>
He was paralyzed by the fear of falling into the water.
The <unk> branches of the trees are submerged in Lake <unk> and they often catch networks and children, and fear, they get to the water to unlock the branches.
Many are <unk>
Since remember, it's always been forced to work in the lake.
For fear of his love is not going to flee and, like the entire life has been treated with cruelty, <unk> is the youngest slaves under their charge.
I met these guys at five o'clock in the morning, when they were <unk> the latest networks, but they had been working from the <unk>
<unk> and <unk>
And it fits to point out that these networks weigh over 400 pounds when they're filled with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued in a village of fishermen.
I met him in a refuge where the <unk> <unk> victims of slavery.
Kofi is the possible.
Who will come to be because someone decided to make a difference in their life?
<unk> for a road in Ghana with <unk> partners, the <unk> a <unk> who was suddenly accelerated and <unk> our car and played the window.
It was asked by a way of land to the jungle.
At the end of the road, we were going to get out of the car, and he asked the driver to go out very quickly.
Then we signal this path barely visible and said, "This is the way, this is the path.
As we started to go down, we took the <unk> that <unk> the way and after walking around an hour we found that the road was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put the photos of photos on my head as I would get to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> road ended up in the course of course, and we had a mass of holes that could fit into a football field, and they were all full of <unk> workers.
A lot of women had strapped on their back, and as they were looking for gold <unk> they were looking for <unk> <unk>
<unk> is used in the <unk> process.
These miners are <unk> in a good part of Ghana.
When they came out of the <unk> they were <unk> in their own sweating.
I remember looking at his tired, tired, <unk> given that many had been underground for 72 hours.
The pits have to be 90 feet and these people carry heavy heavy bags that then will be shipped to another area where they <unk> the rock in order to pull out the gold.
In the first hand, the site seems to be full of strong men and <unk> but if you look closer, but if you look closer at the margin and work at work at the least lucky ones and also children.
They're all victims of injuries, and violence and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> victim is going to end up like this victim of tuberculosis and <unk> per few years old.
This is <unk> When his father died, his uncle took it to work with him in the mines.
As he died, his uncle, <unk> the debt of the uncle that force to be a slave in mines.
When I met him, I had worked in the mines 14 and the leg injury that you see here is a product of an accident in the <unk> so serious that the doctors said it must be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has tuberculosis, and yet that, is forced to work on night and day in that mine.
Yet, he dreams of being liberated and educated with local activists like <unk> the <unk> and it's this kind of determination, of face to a remote possibility of what inspired me a lot respect.
I want to throw light over slavery.
Did you know that their images would be seen by you all over the world.
I wanted you to know that we will have testimony to them and we'll do everything possible to help change their lives.
I really believe that if we can see each other as human beings, then it's very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These images are not of magazines. They're from people, people like you and like me, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There is no day going to happen that I don't think of these many beautiful, beautiful people that I've had the great honor to meet.
I hope that these images actually bring a force on the people you see in people like you, and I hope that that force turns into a fire and that fire <unk> light on slavery because without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do math math and there's a peculiar problem for whom the <unk> are like the management,
Nobody knows what the hell do we do.
So today, I want to try to explain to you what I do.
Dance is one of the most human activities.
We <unk> the <unk> of <unk> and the dancers of <unk> -- that we'll see later on.
But the ballet demands an extraordinary training level -- a high level of dexterity and probably some <unk> initial <unk> that well can have a genetic role.
Sadly, the neurological disorders such as Parkinson's diseases gradually destroy this extraordinary ability as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who, in his time, was a virtuous dancer <unk>
In the last few years, it has made a lot of progress in the treatment.
However, there are <unk> millions of people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need tools to be able to detect the disease before it is too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in an objective way and ultimately the only way we will know if there's a cure to be when we have an objective measure and <unk>
But it's frustrating that for Parkinson's and other disorders of movement are not biological <unk> so they don't have blood analysis and the best thing we have is a neurological test of 20 minutes.
You have to go to a clinic to do it. It's very, very expensive, and that means that out of the clinical trials, they have never been done.
And what if patients could do it at home?
That would save a <unk> trip to the clinic. What if patients could get the exam to themselves?
You don't need to be personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the <unk> clinic.
So what I want to <unk> as a way of a try, you see, in a certain sense at least, we are all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the <unk> <unk>
It shows somebody healthy as it makes sounds like to speak, and we can imagine it as dancers of a <unk> <unk> because we have to coordinate all those vocal organs.
And like <unk> it requires an extraordinary level of training.
Let's think about the time that it takes a child to learn to speak.
And from the sound, we can trace the position of the vocal cords as you get to them, and as the Parkinson's affects the <unk> it also affects the <unk> organs.
On the bottom of you can see an example of <unk> irregular ropes.
We see the same <unk>
<unk> <unk> weakness <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these exams based on the voice with clinical trials -- well, both of them are not <unk>
<unk> test is not <unk> they are both using existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole number of hospitals to do it.
Both of these are <unk> OK, but in addition to <unk> tests are not <unk>
I mean, they can be <unk>
They are very quickly, take about 30 seconds as a lot.
They're <unk> and we all know what happens.
When something takes a cost so <unk> it has a mass scale.
These are some amazing lists to help address.
We can reduce the hard <unk> of patients.
I would not have to go to the clinic for listening.
<unk> monitoring we could get targets.
We could make a massive amount of low-cost clinical trials for clinical trials and for the first time, <unk> <unk>
We have the chance to start looking for the first <unk> of the disease before it's too late.
So when the first steps in that sense, we are launching the <unk> <unk> <unk>
Along with <unk> and <unk> we want to record a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start addressing these targets.
We have local lines for about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with or without Parkinson's -- it can call it under the price of a while, and I'm pleased to announce that we've already reached six percent of the goal in just eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly: So <unk> taking all these samples of, say, 10,000 people, you can say who is healthy and who not?
What do you take out of these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yeah. What's happening is that during the call -- you have to indicate if you have or not disease.
<unk> You see, some people may not <unk> You may not get it.
But we're going to get a very large sample of data in different circumstances, and do it in different circumstances, because we're looking at <unk> the factors of confusion in pursuit of the actual markers of the disease.
TR: You have a <unk> of accuracy at this moment?
<unk> much more than that.
Actually, my student <unk> I have to <unk> it has done a fantastic work and now it has shown that it works on the mobile phone network as well as we <unk> the project. We now have 99 percent of accuracy.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's a improvement.
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. <unk> <unk> public.
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March of the 2011, I was <unk> <unk> in New York City.
We are <unk> creatures. gray.
We get rid of the dark, in rooms and no windows -- we avoid sunlight.
We do the <unk> models even more <unk> the perfect even more perfect, we make the impossible, and we can get it into the press all the time, but some of us are really artists with a lot of experience of experience and a real taste for images and a real <unk>
On March 11 of 2011, I saw from my house, just like the rest of the world, the events that are happening in Japan.
Shortly after that, an organization where it was <unk> there was <unk> in the place working as part of the <unk> team.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers we knew that we couldn't stay at home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
The 13 of May, I traveled to <unk>
It's a little fishing village in the <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first people affected by the wave.
The water level recorded it reaches over 24 feet tall and more than three miles into the ground.
As you can imagine, the village was <unk>
<unk> rubble from the channels and the <unk>
<unk> schools. We took the slime back, and we leave the lists to be <unk> and <unk>
We took tons and tons of dead fish, <unk> from the local factory <unk>
We <unk> and we loved it.
For weeks, both the volunteers like the neighbors found similar things.
They found pictures and photos of photos and cameras and punch cards.
Everybody did the same thing.
We <unk> and take them to different places of the villages around the <unk>
It wasn't until I realized that those pictures represented an enormous part of the personal losses that people had <unk>
While he went out of the wave, and to save his lives, they had to abandon everything they had.
At the end of my first week I started to help in a <unk> center of the people.
It helped clean the bathrooms to <unk> giant <unk>
This place turned out to be the place of the village where the center of <unk> <unk> the photos.
And there they were <unk> and I had the honor that that day <unk> in me to clean the photos.
This was exciting and inspiring, had heard the expression beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until beyond my horizons that something happened.
When you look at the pictures, I found some that they had more than a hundred years, some were still in the lab, I couldn't avoid thinking like <unk> how to fix that <unk> and I knew that hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I entered Facebook contacted some of them, and the next morning, the answer was so overwhelming and positive, that I knew we needed to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
I wasn't too <unk> but where the water had <unk> the face of the girl who had to be <unk> with very precision and <unk>
Anyway, that little girl would not have the appearance of it, and that would be as tragic as I had the photo <unk>
And over the time of time, they came for luck and more <unk> and it took more <unk> so it went back on Facebook and <unk> and five days later 80 people from 12 countries volunteered to help.
Within two weeks I had 150 people <unk>
And in Japan, in July, we <unk> a village <unk> to the north of <unk>
So once a week we use our scanner in the libraries of temporal libraries were <unk> where people were going to reclaim their pictures.
The time that we <unk> in <unk> is a different story, it depended on the <unk> of the photos.
He could be involved with an hour. It could be <unk>
He could make months months.
This <unk> had to draw up by hand using the <unk> areas whose color and detail was not destroyed.
It took a long time.
The water destroyed all of these photos were <unk> in saltwater, covered with bacteria, with seaweed, even with oil, all of it along with the time step along with the time of time continue to <unk> so it was an important part of the project.
We couldn't <unk> the photo unless I was clean, dry and had been <unk> by his <unk>
We were lucky with <unk>
We have a <unk> of a <unk>
It is very easy to harm even more the photos already <unk>
As a <unk> the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures were very lucky in the photos.
I had begun to <unk> she was stopped by realizing that the <unk> even more.
I also had <unk>
Without them, the images of her husband and their own face would not have <unk> we could <unk> the images in a single photo and <unk> the whole picture.
When I picked their pictures shared something from his history with us.
A few colleagues from her husband found the pictures at a fire station between the rubble pretty far away from where she used to be his house, but his colleagues would <unk>
The tsunami, her husband was the <unk> to close the barriers to the wave.
He had to go inside the water as the <unk> <unk>
Her little children, not so small now, but their two children were in school, in different schools.
One of them was caught in the water.
He took a week to find his family and know that everyone had survived.
The day I gave her her photos his youngest son <unk>
For her, despite all this, those pictures were the best gift that he could do -- something that he could go back to look at, something that I could remember from the past I would not have been marked by that March when everything in his life changed or was destroyed.
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined there, hundreds of them helped us to clean up more of <unk> photographs, and the great <unk> -- the great majority came out of their <unk>
Over 500 volunteers all over the world helped us back to 90 families -- hundreds of pictures of totally <unk> and <unk>
During this time, we don't really spend more than 1,000 dollars in equipment and materials, most of them on ink to <unk>
We took pictures all the time.
A picture is a memory of someone or something, a relationship, a <unk>
They are <unk> of our memories and stories, the last thing we would take it, but the first thing that we would take to look for.
This is about the project to restore little pieces of humanity, to bring someone their connection to the past.
When a picture like this comes back to someone, a huge difference in the life of the person that the <unk>
This project also made a great difference in the life of <unk>
Some of them connected with something bigger -- to bring something, using their talent for something that is not thin image of perfect skin.
To finish I'd like to read this electronic email -- I sent it Cindy the day I came back from Japan after six months.
As <unk> I couldn't avoid thinking about the people and the stories shown in the images.
One particular picture with women of different ages from the grandmother to the small girl, gathering around a baby, I would tell me, because a picture of my family my grandmother, my mother, and my daughter was just <unk> hangs out of our wall.
In the whole world, all of our basic needs are the same. Right?
Thank you.  <unk>
<unk> <unk> inspired us and curiosity with this picture of a bullet that passes an apple through an exhibition in an exhibition of just a millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not about a million or a thousand people, but one trillion frames per second.
Let me introduce you a new kind of <unk> <unk> a new technical technique that can create video slow camera into motion.
And with that we can create cameras that can see behind the <unk> beyond the line of vision, or see the interior of the body without using X-rays, and actually challenge the camera idea.
If I take a laser pointer and turn it into a second <unk> or it is, in a number of <unk> to create a <unk> package of just one millimeter size.
And that <unk> package -- that <unk> travel at the speed of light, and again, a million times faster than a common bullet is going on.
If we take that bullet and this <unk> package and <unk> in this bottle, how do you disperse those photons into this <unk>
What is the light of light in <unk> camera.
Now, all of this --   Remember that all this happens in less than a <unk> is what it takes to travel the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see light in motion.
Coca-Cola is not <unk> this research --  -- so many things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> enters the bottle of photons which starts to <unk> and that, inside, starts <unk>
Part of the light is <unk> it goes to the table, and we started seeing these <unk>
Many of the photons in the bottom line the cap and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a bubble <unk> it bounces inside.
At that time, the waves travel on the table and because of the reflections of the top of the <unk> it looks at the bottom of the bottle, after several boxes, that the reflections of <unk>
Now, if we take a <unk> <unk> and we make it run the same distance and we see it in slow camera to about 10 billion times, how much think it would lead us to look at that film?
One day? A week? Actually, a whole year.
It would be a very boring movie --  from a slow <unk>
And what about <unk> <unk>
You can see the waves that are <unk> from the tomato table, and the <unk> wall.
It's like throwing a rock on a pond.
It is the way that nature paints a picture, I thought about a <unk> at the time, but of course our eyes see a <unk>
But if you look at once more and more this <unk> you'll realize that, as the light is <unk> of tomato sauce, is still bright.
Why? Because the tomato is <unk> and the light bounces off inside and it goes back after several <unk> a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is on your cell phones -- they will be able to go to the supermarket, and check if the fruit is mature without having to <unk>
What do we create this camera at MIT?
Like photographers, you know, if we take a photo <unk> it comes into very little light.
But we're going to go a billion times faster than the shortest exhibition -- so just going into some light.
We sent that <unk> that <unk> package of times, and we recorded over and over again with a very <unk> <unk> we took those data <unk> and the <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all those data into crude and <unk> in a interesting way.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible, they can become invisible, too.
And if a new power of a future <unk> would allow you to see the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw some light on the door. I would go into the room, one piece is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera.
And where we could extract those multiple <unk> of light.
It's not science fiction. We built it.
The left, is our <unk>
Behind the wall is a <unk> and <unk> the light on the door.
And after the publication of our article in <unk> <unk>
And a tiny fraction of the photons going back to the camera -- but interestingly, in slightly different times.
And as we have a camera that works like this, our <unk> has unique capacities.
It has very good time resolution, and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances up to the door and also even the hidden objects, but we don't know what point that it corresponds to what to a distance.
So Al projecting a laser can record a <unk> picture that, you see on the screen, it really doesn't make any sense.
But we will take a lot of images like that, dozens of images, we <unk> them, and we will try to analyze the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we can see the <unk> object.
Can we see this <unk>
This is our reconstruction here.
We have things to explore before we get this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that <unk> collisions with what is at the <unk>
Or we could look for survivors in dangerous conditions, looking at light reflected by open windows.
Or we could build <unk> able to see the inside of the body by having <unk> and the same for <unk>
But of course, because of the fabric and the blood is quite hard, so this is actually a request for scientists to start thinking about <unk> as a new <unk> <unk> to fix the problems of mammography in the next generation.
So as <unk> <unk> he himself is a scientist, it became the science of art, a art.
And I realized that all the <unk> of data we collected every time are not just for scientific motions.
So create a new form of computational photography with slow motion and color code.
And let's look at those ripples remember, the time between each of those waves is just a few <unk> a second.
But this is also something that's fun.
If you look at the waves under the <unk> these are going on.
The waves should move toward us.
What is happening here?
It turns out that we are recording almost at the speed of light, we have strange effects. So Einstein would have loved to see this image.
The order where the events in the world are sometimes <unk> to the camera.
We <unk> the corresponding challenges of space and time, we can correct this <unk>
It's time. Thank you.
Hello. This is my mobile phone.
A mobile phone can <unk> your life, and give you individual freedom.
With a mobile phone, a crime against humanity in Syria.
With a cell phone you can tweet a message and start a protest in Egypt.
With a cell phone you can record a song, it would be able to get famous.
This is all possible with a mobile phone.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and I live in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that moment, to this city.
Here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people <unk> in search of a change.
This is the fall of 1989. You can imagine if all these people were gathering that <unk> looking for a change, had a mobile phone in your pocket.
Who from <unk> have a cell here?
<unk>
Raise your mobile phones.
<unk> A Android, a Blackberry, wow!
That's a lot of all of you today have a mobile phone.
But today I'm talking about me, of my mobile phone, and what life changed my life.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> of information.
<unk> data.
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the E.U. Commission presented a <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
This directive says that every European telephone company, every Internet company has to store a full range of information range of users.
Who calls <unk> who sends an email to <unk>
Who sent a text.
And if we use the mobile phone, where we are.
All of this information is stored for at least six months, and to two years, in your phone company, or your Internet <unk>
And in all Europe people stood up and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this data <unk>
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the phone providers and the Internet providers, all this information about us.
There was lawyers, journalists, priests, priests, everyone said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see about ten thousand people who went out to the streets of <unk> and they said, <unk> not <unk>
And some of them even said that this would be <unk> 2.0.
The <unk> was the secret police of East Germany.
And I also wondered if this really works.
Can you store all this information on us?
Every time I use your <unk>
So I asked my phone <unk> <unk> that at that time, was the largest telephone company in Germany, and please let me get all the information that you had about me.
I asked them once, and I went back to me, and I didn't get a concrete answer. It was all the <unk>
But then I said, "I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to <unk> a lawsuit because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we don't give you this information.
At the end, they <unk> an agreement.
<unk> the demand and they sent me the information that I <unk>
Meanwhile, the Veterans' Court Court failed the <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly thing on brown with a CD inside.
And in the CD there was this.
Thirty thousand <unk> <unk> 30 <unk>
At first I saw it, and I said, well, it's a huge archive right.
But after a time I realized that it's my life.
There's six months of my life in this archive.
It was a little bit <unk> what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I step at night, what am I doing.
But then I said, I want this information to <unk>
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what the retention of data.
So along with <unk> <unk> and Open <unk> City, we did this.
This is a six-year-old visualization of my life.
You can come up and butt out, go back and forward.
You can see every step I want.
And you can see how I go from the train to <unk> and how often I call it at the way.
All of this is possible with this information.
That's a little scary.
But it's not just about me.
It's all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she's called, talk about a couple of times.
Then they call me some friends and they call each other.
And then one calls each other, and the other one, and we ended up with this great communications network.
You can see how their people communicate to each time they call each other what time they sleep.
You can see all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society is doing.
If you have access to this information, you can control your society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the form of your society, because you know who talk to whom, who send you an email to whom, all of this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all these people in the streets in Berlin, in the fall of 1989, they had a mobile phone on your pocket.
And the <unk> had known who I participated in this protest, and if the <unk> would have known who the leaders, this would never have happened.
The fall of the Berlin <unk> would never have happened.
And as a result, neither the <unk> of <unk>
Because today state agencies and companies want to store so much information about us as possible.
They want to have the ability to follow our lives and want to <unk> it forever.
But the <unk> and living in the digital age is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for the <unk>
You have to fight for that every day.
When you go home to their friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century, and that is not <unk>
When you go home to your representative that just because business and state agencies can store some information, they don't have to do it.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what information do you store for you.
So in the future, every time you use their mobile phones to remind you that they have to fight for the <unk> in the digital era.
Thank you.
Hi <unk> what happens?
It's not enough.
Hi <unk> what happens?
I call myself <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor who brought me to the world.
<unk> my mom six times in six different directions, <unk> the poor of me in the process.
As a result, I've got cerebral palsy, which is so <unk> all the time.
<unk>
It's <unk> I'm like a mixture of <unk>
And Muhammad <unk>
The P. C. It's not genetics.
It's not <unk> it can't be <unk>
No one would <unk> the uterus and not the <unk> because my parents were cousins, even though they are.
It's only about accidents, as I came to birth.
Now, I'm not <unk> I'm not a source of inspiration.
You feel bad for me, because at some point in life, you've wanted to be disabled.
Let's go for a walk.
<unk> Christmas, they are at the shopping center, driving around parking lot, and what do you see?
16 places empty in empty spaces.
And they think, "God, can I be at least a little bit <unk>
In addition, I tell you, I have 99 problems, and the P. C. It's just one of them.
There is a <unk> of the <unk> I would win the gold medal.
I'm a <unk> Muslim woman, and I live in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, you might be able to do it.
I'm from "Jurassic <unk> in New Jersey.
I always love my neighborhood and my disease had the same <unk>
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my home to New York, it might.
A lot of people with cerebral palsy, but my parents don't believe it <unk>
The mantra of my father was, "Can you <unk> it -- <unk> <unk>
If my three older sisters <unk> I <unk>
If my three older sisters went to the public school, my parents would go to the school system, and they were <unk> that I was also out, and if we didn't pull out all the ultimate note to the <unk> of my mother.
My father taught me about walking five years to put my <unk> in his feet and just walking.
Another approach that I used to use was hang on a dollar in front of me to make it <unk>
The <unk> that I wear was very strong and ...
Yeah. The first day in the child kindergarten was walking like a <unk> champion that has received a lot of <unk>
At growing up, there was only six Arabs in my city, and they were all of the family.
Now there are 20 Arabic, and they keep all of the family, and I think nobody realized we weren't <unk>
This was before 9/11, and that politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> to <unk> as <unk>
The people that I grew up had had problems with my faith.
However, it looked like a lot of <unk> death for the <unk>
I told you that I had enough fat to live three months without eat, so let's stop from dawn to sunset it's very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yes, in <unk> It's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford physical therapy, so they sent me to the dance.
I learned to dance with <unk> and I learned that I can walk with <unk>
I am from New Jersey, and there we want to be <unk> so if my friends used to wear <unk> I am too.
And when my friends were going to spend the summer holidays on the coast of Jersey, I wasn't going.
I spent my summers in a war zone, because my parents were afraid if we don't go back to Palestine all the <unk> we would get in <unk>
On holidays in summer to often my father was about <unk> so I was drinking milk from <unk> to make me warm cups on the back, and I remember the water <unk> and I remember the water <unk> and I was like, <unk> <unk>
But the <unk> cure was the yoga.
I must say that it's very boring, but before I do yoga was a stand-up comedian that I couldn't stand up with <unk> <unk>
And now I can focus on the head.
My parents <unk> this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at the <unk> Hospital.
I went to college through the positive affirmative action, and I got a grant for the <unk> University of the State of Arizona, because I went in all the <unk>
It was like the <unk> pet of the Department of theater.
Everybody <unk>
I did all the tasks of the least intelligent, I took the highest note in my lectures, and also in their classrooms.
Every time I was doing a scene of the <unk> <unk> my <unk>
But I never got a role.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to make a work called <unk> very slow in Jackson.
It's a work of a girl with <unk>
I was a girl with <unk>
So I started screaming at the four <unk> <unk> I would have a <unk>
I have <unk> <unk>
At the end of the end of it <unk>
Thank God <unk> I am <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  They gave him <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running the director of the department, crying and <unk> as if someone would have killed my cat, to ask her why and she told me that I couldn't do the <unk>
And I said, <unk> if I can't do the <unk> you can't do the <unk>
It was a paper that literally had been born and gave it to an actor.
My college was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a story of <unk> actors without disability for any disabled <unk>
I came home home, and my first tour, <unk> was like an extra thing in a <unk>
My dream became true.
And I knew it would be <unk> from <unk> to <unk> friend <unk>
Instead, I stayed there as a <unk> I didn't see it more than the <unk> and it was clear to me that the <unk> <unk> were not <unk> actors <unk> <unk> with disability.
We just get to perfect people.
But there were exceptions to the rule.
I grew up looking at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: they were <unk>
So I made it <unk>
On my first tour, I took <unk> <unk> <unk> to New Jersey, and I will never forget the face of the first comedian that led to the face of the <unk> that he was at high speed on the New Jersey <unk> with a driver that had cerebral <unk>
I worked in clubs. All across the United States, and also in Arabic in the Middle East and <unk>
Some people say I'm the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know you never heard that little rumor that says that women are not fun, and we find it very fun.
In 2003, my brother of another mother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the <unk> <unk> <unk> Festival now in his 10.
Our goal was to change the negative image of <unk> in media and then remind the <unk> of <unk> that <unk> and Arabic is not <unk>
<unk> to Arabs was much easier than fighting the challenge of stigma of disability.
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I went as invited to the news program by <unk> it has Keith <unk>
I walked as if I went to a graduate dance, I went back to a study and sat in a wheelchair.
I looked at the director and I said, <unk> can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I clung to the <unk> desk.
I finally had my opportunity and the <unk> I knew they wouldn't come back to me.
But not only Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but I was just <unk> I was just <unk> my chair.
A fun thing I learned in direct with Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
It says that children are <unk> but they never <unk> from me and no longer <unk>
All of a sudden, my disability on the Internet became <unk>
I would play online clips like, "Why do you <unk>
"It's <unk>
And my favorite, <unk> <unk>
What the disease has it?
We really should pray for her."
A guy suggested even that I would add my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk>
disability is as visual as race.
If someone in the wheels can't make <unk> then you can't make someone in the wheelchair.
<unk> are the <unk> Yes, <unk> man.
<unk> are the largest minority of the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
The doctors were saying that I don't get to <unk> but I'm here in front of you.
But we have grown up with media, but I don't think they <unk>
I hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in media and in everyday life.
Maybe if there was more positive images, that <unk> less hate on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
We may even need the whole society to teach well our children.
My <unk> journey has taken me to very spectacular places.
I came to <unk> by the red carpet <unk> by the <unk> Susan <unk> and the <unk> <unk> <unk>
I got to act in a film with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> the incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the world <unk> <unk> have become <unk>
I was <unk> in representation of the great state of New Jersey in the <unk> of 2008.
And I founded <unk>
It was the only time my father saw me live alive, and I'm doing this talk to his memory.
<unk> peace, <unk>
I call myself <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can.
I would like to tell you a story about a young town.
I don't know his name, but I know his story.
She lives in a small town in the South <unk>
This village is near <unk>
<unk> drives the small village to poverty and the edge of the <unk>
Without it there, it goes to the big city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When it comes there, there is no opportunities, no job, no <unk>
He just lived in a tent in the city outside <unk>
After maybe a year ago, nothing.
One day you see a guy who offers it to <unk> after dinner at all.
He meets a dynamic group of people, which gives it a break.
It gets a little bit of money for you to buy new clothes, money to send home to your family.
He presented to a young man.
They finally got home.
It starts a new life.
It has a life goal.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky <unk> a bomb.
That kid from that little village with the dreams of the great city was the <unk> terrorist -- and that dynamic group of people were the <unk> a connected terrorist organization with the Qaeda.
So how do the story of a young woman trying to pursue their dreams in the city ends with him <unk>
He was waiting for him.
I was waiting for an opportunity, waiting to start his future, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing it arrived.
This was the first thing that did it about what we call the <unk> <unk>
And his story is repeated in urban centers around the world.
This is the story of the <unk> young urban <unk> that <unk> riots in <unk> <unk> in London, looking for something beyond the <unk> <unk>
For young people, the promise of the city, the great dream of the city is the opportunity, of jobs, but young people don't participate in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often the youth who suffers from the highest rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three in five people living in cities will be under 18 years.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if we don't give them any opportunities -- the story of the <unk> of <unk> the door of access to terrorism, to violence -- to be the history of cities 2.0.
And in my hometown of birth, 70 percent of young people are <unk>
70 percent doesn't work on school.
They don't do pretty much anything.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the <unk> Hospital the hospital where I was born.
I remember going to that hospital <unk> <unk> thinking, and if I had never gone?
And if I had seen me forced to be in that same <unk> of <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure about the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to harbor a few baby leaders in a business journey.
<unk> on the top 90 young leaders <unk>
We sat down and we had a rain of ideas about solutions to the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He went to the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no job, no opportunities.
I remember when he was a graduate graduate college college to be the perfect white white for Al <unk> and other organizations terrorists, to be <unk>
They were looking for people like him.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the most obstacle to reach about point B is the streets.
<unk> years of civil war have destroyed completely the traffic system, and a motorcycle can be the easiest way to <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
It started a <unk> company.
It started <unk> <unk> in the local residents who they could not have <unk>
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of his family and friends, and your dream is at some moment to expand to hundreds of motorcycles over the next three years.
Why is this story?
What does this different story do?
I think its ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the corporate spirit and I think that the business spirit can be the most powerful tool against <unk>
<unk> young people to be the creators of economic opportunities that are looking for so much.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
He was <unk> to train some of the young people at the summit of business initiative and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business entrepreneurship.
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen in over 22 years, and until she came, until Mohamed arrived, if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were from plastic sent from abroad.
If I read someone, "When was the last time you saw <unk>
For those who grew up during the civil war, the answer is: <unk>
So Mohamed saw a chance.
It started a company of <unk> and <unk> design.
I created a farm on the outside of <unk> and started to grow <unk> and <unk> who said they could survive the hard climate of <unk>
And he started delivery of flowers for wedding creating gardens in the houses, and the companies of the city, and now it's working on the creation of the first public park in <unk> in 22 years.
There's no public parks in <unk>
It wants to create a space where the young families, the young people, they can go together, and as he says, smell the pink ones.
By the way, he doesn't grow up because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire the young people, and in that room, the presence of Mohamed had a really profound impact on young people.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought about working for an NGO, working for government, but their history, their innovation, actually had a strong impact on them.
They forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunities.
encouraged to believe that they could be entrepreneurs, that might be <unk> of change.
By the end of the day, they had innovative solutions for some of the greatest challenges facing the city.
We have business solutions for local problems.
So, inspiring young people and create a culture of business is really a big step, but young people need capital to make their ideas happen.
They need expertise and guidance for <unk> in the development of their businesses.
<unk> young people with the resources that they need, <unk> the support they need to go from conception to creation, and create <unk> for urban growth.
For me, the business spirit is something more than starting a business.
It's a social impact.
Mohamed is not just selling flowers.
I think he's selling hope.
Their Park of <unk> this is how it calls it when it's created, transform the way people see their city.
<unk> hired kids from the street to help rent and keep the motorcycles for him.
He gave them the chance to escape the <unk> <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is: to turn young people into entrepreneurs, <unk> and eat their innovation and will have more stories about the flowers and Parks of the Peace <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to <unk> with my father in the <unk> mountains, a <unk> area north of New York City.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest <unk>
The sun would make the leaves <unk> like a <unk> and not to be on the way that we <unk> almost could pretend that we were the first human beings to step on that land.
We got to our camp.
It was a shed in a <unk> with a beautiful lake -- when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the <unk> there was a <unk> of about four square meters with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> who were too lazy like to pull out what they thought I was going to clean up their <unk>
That question went on with me, and it was <unk>
Who cleans our <unk>
No matter how to <unk> or where they would do -- who will clean our trash in <unk>
Who cleans our garbage in Rio or in Paris or in <unk>
Here in New York City, the Department of <unk> cleans our trash structure, and <unk> tons of waste and two tons of <unk> products every day.
I wanted to meet as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What do you feel like to use the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and walked along the pathways, and I interviewed people in offices and I interviewed the whole city, and I learned a lot of it was still a <unk>
I needed a lot more.
So I started working like <unk>
Now I wasn't just traveling in the trucks. I was <unk>
And <unk> the mechanical <unk> and <unk> the snow.
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
Everybody asked about the smell.
It's there, but it's not as <unk> as you believe it, and in the days that it's very hard to be <unk>
It takes a lot to get used to weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years and their bodies continued to <unk> the weight of getting over their body tons of garbage every week.
It's also the danger.
According to the Bureau of <unk> <unk> waste is one of the most dangerous <unk> of the country, and I learned why.
You're coming out and entering the traffic all the day and pass our <unk> around you.
They just want to <unk> so in general the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for the <unk>
And also the trash itself is full of dangers that often fall from the truck and cause terrible damage.
I also learned about the relentless of the trash.
When you get out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that the trash is like a force of nature itself.
It never stopped coming.
It's also like a form of breathing or circulation.
It always must be movement.
And also the stigma.
I think stigma is especially ironic because I believe that waste waste is the most important hand of the streets of the city, for three reasons.
They're the first <unk> of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste in very efficient and effective way every day, this starts to <unk> their containers and their dangers inherent to make us in very real ways.
<unk> that we had been controlled for decades and centuries come back to <unk>
The economy needs it.
If we can't get rid of the old thing, we don't have a space for what the economies of the economy begin to fail when it's <unk>
I'm not advocating for capitalism, just pointing your relationship.
And then it's what I call our average average speed necessary.
I mean just the speed that we used to be used to move in the <unk>
We usually don't get <unk> and we don't <unk> and we have our coffee cup -- our <unk> bag -- our <unk> bottle.
We use them <unk> we forget about them, because we know there's a job force on the other side that you need to be <unk>
So I want to suggest to you a couple of ways to think about the collection of waste that maybe help you reduce the stigma and <unk> that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
Their work, I think, is almost <unk>
They're in the street every day, in a <unk>
They use a uniform in a lot of cities.
You know when they <unk>
And their work allows us to do our work.
They're almost a way of relief.
The flow that keeps us safely from ourselves, from our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow should always stay in one way or another.
One day after September 11, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a waste <unk> truck on the street, grabbed my little son and went down the stairs <unk> and there was a man doing his journey of recycled paper as I did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank you for doing his work that particular day, but I started to cry.
And I looked at me and just <unk> and he said, "We're going to be okay.
Let's be okay."
Shortly after that I started doing the collection of waste and I went back to that man.
It's called <unk> and we worked together many times and made us good friends.
I want to believe that <unk> was right.
Let's be okay.
But in our efforts to <unk> the way we exist on this planet as a species we have to include and to have all the costs, even the cost of very real human cost.
The city waste is what we think when we talk about trash, they represent three percent of the amount of <unk>
It's a remarkable statistic here.
So in the flow of their days and their lives, the next thing that you see somebody whose work is to clean the crap of you, you have a moment for <unk>
<unk> a moment to tell you thank you.
My work is focused on the connection of thinking about our community life, forming part of the environment where architecture is naturally naturally in the conditions and the local traditions.
I brought in two recent projects today like this.
Both projects are located in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the end of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a shopping center in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis Ababa, <unk>
This is the kind of construction that showed us as an example, to my team and to me, about what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to go out <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings there are many in the city we realized that there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores that people cannot afford to buy things.
Secondly, you need to put a lot of energy because the <unk> <unk> generates heat in the interior, so we need a lot of <unk>
In a city where this should not happen because it's a temperate weather that goes from 20 to 25 degrees over the year.
And third, it has nothing to do with Africa or Ethiopia.
It's a <unk> of a place that is so rich in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I was really captivated with the old market that is this structure in the air to the free air where thousands of people, go and buy things every little <unk>
There's also that idea of using the public space to generate foreign activity.
So I thought that was what I really wanted to design, not a mall.
But the question was how to build a building of a new building, by applying these principles.
The next challenge was presented to the survey the site, which is located in a very much growth zone, where a lot of the buildings that we now see in the image, not yet.
And in addition to two parallel streets that are not communicating in an extension of hundreds of feet.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets, put all the entries from the building.
And this spreads with a <unk> <unk> which creates a space in the building in the building that it was <unk> by its own shape of the sun, and the rain <unk>
And around this space we've applied the market idea with small businesses, which changes on every floor because of the form of space.
I also thought, how to close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that would be <unk> to the local weather conditions.
And I started thinking about a similar tissue to a concrete shell.
Then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons in the dresses of the <unk>
They have properties of fractal geometry, and this helped me do the <unk>
We're building that with these little <unk> pieces that are windows that leave the air and light it in a controlled way inside of the building.
This is <unk> with these little color crystals that use the light inside the building to illuminate the building at night.
With these ideas, it wasn't easy to convince developers because they thought, "That's not a mall. It was not what we <unk>
But finally, we all realized that this idea of the market was much more profitable than the mall because in the end of the <unk> there were more local to sell.
And then the idea of the facade was much more economically, not only because of the material in comparison with glass, but also because it was no longer necessary.
So we get certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve the energy <unk> for the building in a city where electricity is short almost every day.
So we get a great advantage to put <unk> on the roof.
And then under those panels we think on the ceiling like a new public space with meeting areas that would create this urban <unk>
And these <unk> on the roof, which are collected water for the <unk>
They're waiting for the next year, because we go through the fifth floor of the construction floor.
The second example is a master plan for 2,000 apartments and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to do a very, very big project, the biggest thing that I was designed, I needed not only to understand the city of Tunisia, but also their environment, their tradition and culture.
During that analysis I started attention to the <unk> a <unk> structure of ancient ancient -- that was surrounded by a dozen closing gates of connected access to the close lines.
When I went to the first design operation, the first design operation that we did was to expand the existing streets by creating 12 similar building blocks and features that there are in Yemen and other cities in Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we select some of these points in relation to the idea of <unk> doors with straight lines, and this shifted the initial model.
And the last operation was to think about the cell, the little cell in the project, like the flat, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would be the best orientation for an apartment in the <unk> climate.
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore a natural <unk>
So we <unk> a scheme that make sure that most of the apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that's almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then in the <unk> plant, we have all the connections to the pedestrians.
And it also responds to local norms that set up a higher density in higher levels and a lower density in the plant, plant.
And it also reinforces this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like giving the community the space occupied by construction.
It's where all the neighbors, they can go up and make activities like running a <unk> <unk> for the morning, or jump from a building to another.
These two examples, have a common approach in the design process.
And also, they're in emerging countries, where you can see the cities that are literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in people's lives changes communities and local economies at the same pace that buildings.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple solutions, but <unk> that improve the relationship between the community and the environment, and they have as objective connecting nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl joined our class. It was so remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
He had a lot of very bright hair, and a little <unk> of <unk> it was super strong for the capitals of states, very good for <unk>
I ended up that year and I was full of jealousy, until I <unk> my sinister plan.
One day I got a time after the exit of school, I was a little late and hid in the girls' bathroom.
When the shoreline was <unk> salt, I entered the classroom, I took off the table of my master's book table.
And then I did.
I <unk> the ratings from my <unk> just a little bit like this.
All the <unk>  And I signed up to my book to the <unk> but to see, some of my other colleagues had very good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put all rows of <unk> and myself a row of that, just because of being there, because it <unk>
I'm still surprised what I did.
I don't understand how the idea came from.
I don't understand why I felt good at doing that.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I never <unk>
It's that it was all the obvious <unk>
I never <unk>
But most of all, I would tell me the reason that I had to bother me that this little girl was so small, and it was so very good at <unk>
It was <unk> jealousy.
They're so <unk> and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
And the birds -- birds are very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one cause of spouses in the United States.
And yet, I've never seen a study that <unk> the loneliness, or the long duration or the sadness.
So you have to go to the fiction, because the novels are like the lab when they study the <unk> in all of their possible ways.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if there was no jealousy, <unk> there would be no literature.
I wouldn't have <unk> the <unk> no <unk>
There was no king <unk> or <unk> and a <unk>
I wouldn't have Shakespeare.
<unk> the reading lists of high school because we would be losing the <unk> and the <unk> wouldn't have no <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Without jealousy, there is no <unk> I know it's fashionable to say that <unk> has the answers for everything, and in terms of the jealousy most of them have all.
This year in the age of 100 years of his masterpiece, "In looking for time <unk> the most <unk> study of sexual <unk> and also from the ordinary <unk> -- my God, everything we could have.  And thinking about <unk> we have the details -- right?
We think about a child trying to reconcile sleep.
We think about a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forget how hard that image.
We forget how relentless it is.
I mean, it's about books that Virginia <unk> said were as hard as <unk>
I don't know what the <unk> <unk> but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they go so well together, the novel and the <unk> and <unk> them.
It will be very obvious as the jealousy that you get to the person, their desire, to their <unk> are a very good narrative base.
I don't know. I think we got very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel jealousy, we tell ourselves a story.
One story about other people's lives, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel wrong.
As <unk> and audience, we know exactly what details of the <unk> to <unk> the knife right?
The <unk> make all of the amateur novelists and that is something that was able to understand.
Everything that she does to give me pleasure could give me a <unk> maybe right now."
And it starts to say to himself that story, and since then, <unk> says that every cool charm that <unk> senses on his lover, he adds it to his collection of instruments of <unk> <unk> in his private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, the <unk> of <unk> would have to abandon the country, if they wanted to break off with it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's hard work. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's a <unk> emotion. You have to <unk>
And what are the <unk>
The <unk> get rid of the information.
<unk> use the details.
<unk> like the great <unk> of bright hair, and the cute little <unk> <unk>
The <unk> get rid of the photos.
That's why <unk> is so successful --  -- <unk> links very well with jealousy.
When <unk> is in his <unk> <unk> listening to the <unk> and <unk> to the <unk> of their lover so it defends those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different to the interpretation of an old text or look at a <unk>
He says, "Are these scientific research with real <unk> value.
<unk> is trying to prove that the <unk> look <unk> and make it seem like <unk> but in their <unk> they are searching for knowledge, search for the truth, a really painful truth. In fact, what to <unk> <unk> the more painful, the better.
The pain, the <unk> the <unk> -- these are the pathways to the wisdom of <unk>
He says, "A woman who we need, who makes us suffer, it causes us a much deeper range of much more profound and vital feelings that a wise man who can tell us.
We're telling us that we're going to look for women.
No. I think it's trying to say that the <unk> reveal us ourselves.
And there is some other emotion that makes us <unk> in this particular way.
There's some other emotion to us, our <unk> the horrific ambition and our <unk>
Some other emotion that teaches us to look with intensity so <unk>
Freud would write about this later.
One day, Freud was visited by a very <unk> young man who was used with the idea that her woman was <unk>
And Freud said that there was some strange thing in that man, who didn't bother what his wife.
Well, she was <unk> everyone knew it.
The poor creature was under suspicion without no cause.
But he was looking for things that his wife, without realizing it, behaviors.
<unk> <unk> or just accidentally <unk> with a man?
Freud said that man was becoming the <unk> of his wife.
<unk> are very good at this.
<unk> describe very well how the <unk> make us look with intensity but <unk>
In fact, the more intensely <unk> we are, more we become residents of fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, <unk> take us to make violent and illegal <unk>
<unk> drives us to behave in totally <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking about me for eight years old, but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard about news.
One woman of Michigan of 52 years old was captured by having created a fake account on Facebook since I would send the messages to <unk> itself, for a year.
For a year every year.
She was trying to interview the new girlfriend of his former <unk> <unk> I have to confess that when or this, I reacted to <unk>
Because, let's be realistic.
How huge -- even though it <unk> creativity. Right?
It's like <unk>
Like a novel of Patricia <unk>
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character of the American literature.
This is the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> books that are trying to figure out how the jealousy, <unk> our minds are, and once we are in the sphere in the realm of jealousy, the membrane that separating what might be, can be <unk> in a second.
Let's take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> is going to go from <unk> or want what you have to take out of your self and be <unk> from what ever <unk> and it's under the ground floor, it takes your <unk> <unk> your <unk> your bank accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route of Tom <unk>
I can't give you <unk> all the world, as much as I wanted to.
It's a shame, because we live in times of envy.
We live in times of jealousy.
I mean, we're good citizens of social media, where the coin is <unk> right?
Science will show us the <unk> I'm not safe.
So we're going to do what the characters always do when they're not sure, when they're at a mystery.
Let's go to the <unk> of Baker Street and ask for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> they think about the <unk> in Professor <unk> that criminal genius.
But I have always been <unk> <unk> <unk> the head of <unk> rat <unk> who needs <unk> <unk> needs the <unk> genius, but it <unk>
Oh, my sound is so <unk>
<unk> needs its help, but it <unk> and <unk> with <unk> in the fall of the puzzles.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The <unk> of six <unk> <unk> once you get <unk> in the <unk> to all with its solution, <unk> back to <unk> and says, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And it says that there is no person in <unk> <unk> who wouldn't want to <unk> your hand.
It's one of the few times that we see <unk> in history. I think this is very emotional. That scene is mysterious, right?
It seems like <unk> as a problem of geometry, without emotion.
You know, in a minute <unk> is the opposite side of <unk>
At the next minute you're the same side.
Suddenly, <unk> enables you to admire that idea of being <unk>
It could still be so simple?
What if <unk> are really a matter of geometry, just a question of where we allow us to be in relation to the other?
Well, maybe we don't have to <unk> the greatness of the other.
We can relate to it.
But I like <unk> plans.
So as we expect that happen, let's remember that we have fiction to <unk>
Only fiction <unk> jealousy.
The fiction used to <unk> invites them to the table.
And look at what I would <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We're in excellent company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
The 21st of July 1969, Buzz Aldrin jumped outside the <unk> <unk> module.
Armstrong and <unk> were alone, but his presence in gray surface surface was the culmination of a collective process.
The Apollo program was the largest <unk> in the history of America.
To get to the moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars today, or four percent of the federal budget.
Apollo did work for about 400,000 people and asked about 20,000 companies, universities and universities and government agencies.
People died, people died, including the crew <unk>
But before the Apollo program took 24 men traveled to the moon.
<unk> walked over his surface, of which <unk> after the death of Armstrong took last year, is now the most <unk>
So why do we <unk>
They didn't get a lot of <unk> <unk> pounds of old rocks, and something that 24 <unk> later, a new sense of <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why <unk> The cynics is that they were because President Kennedy wanted to prove to the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the <unk> of <unk> at Rice University in <unk> give us a better idea.
John F. <unk> Some people ask, why do you <unk>
Why do we turn it into our goal?
And you could also ask, why will scale the most <unk>
35 years ago, why is flying over the <unk>
Why does Rice play Rice <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're hard.
Jason <unk> For the <unk> the Apollo wasn't just a <unk> victory about the Cold War.
At the time, the stronger emotion was the <unk> to the transcendence of the powers of technology.
It was because it was great to be able to do it.
The landing on the moon occurred in a context of a long list of technology's list.
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the plane, penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, it was <unk> the <unk> and just eliminated the smallpox.
Technology seemed to have what Alvin <unk> in 1970 called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of mankind, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a ship with a candle, but in 1969, the Apollo crew -- 10 miles <unk>
Since 1970, no human will go back to the moon.
No one has traveled faster than the crew 10, and the joyful <unk> about the power of technology has been <unk> to see that the problems that we imagine that technology would solve how to go to Mars, create a clean energy, cure cancer, or feeding the world population seem to be <unk>
I remember seeing the <unk> <unk>
He was five years old, and my mother told me that I didn't get to the <unk> tube <unk> the rocket Saturn <unk>
I knew today that this would be the last <unk> mission but I was completely sure that I would get to see the colonies on Mars.
So that has occurred to our ability to solve problems with <unk> it has become a common place.
We hear it all the time.
We've heard it for the last two days here, at TED.
It seems like the technologists have been <unk> and had enriched fancy toys, things like <unk> applications and social media, or algorithms that speed up <unk>
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They've expanded and enriched our lives.
But we don't have the great problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's an explanation in the Silicon Valley in Silicon Valley, which is that they have created companies less ambitious than the ones that are <unk> <unk> Microsoft, Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are the <unk> in particular, the incentives that the risk venture offers the entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that risk for the risk of risk caused by the creation of <unk> ideas for <unk> or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
It was mostly going wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when the risk capitalists were at their high point without worrying about the risk of small investments, they could go out in 10 years.
<unk> have always had trouble investing in technologies like energy, which need a huge amount of capital and whose development is in the long term.
No, the reasons why we can't solve the big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes, we chose to solve the big problems.
We could go to Mars if we <unk>
NASA has even designed a plan.
But to go to Mars would require a political decision that would be popular, and that's never going to happen.
We won't go to Mars because everybody thinks there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't solve the big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of the energy consumption of energy consumption is like solar and solar and <unk> Less than two percent, and the reason is absolutely cheap.
Coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar power and wind, and oil is cheaper than the <unk>
We want the sources of alternative energy that can compete in price, don't exist.
Now, technologists, entrepreneurs and economists agree on what politics and international treaties have the development of a <unk> energy development -- a significant increase in research and development development and some kind of control of the price control.
But there is no hope in the current political climate that we will see an energy policy of America or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes the big problems that look like technological, it turns out not to be.
We know for a time that famines are a result of failure on the <unk>
But 30 years of research have taught us that famines are political crisis that affects the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like harvest or systems for storage and <unk> but there will be famines while there were bad governments.
Finally, big issues sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't understand the problem.
The <unk> President of the war was declared to the war in 1971, but soon we discovered that there are many kinds of cancer, some <unk> <unk> and only in the last 10 years, they seem to have found effective and viable.
The hard problems are hard.
It's not true that we couldn't solve the problems with technology.
We can and have -- but these four elements have to be <unk> and the politicians and the population must want to fix the problem, the institutions must be able to support the <unk> it must be really about a <unk> problem and we need to understand it.
The <unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve big problems, and it is true with those bill.
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There's no <unk> competition like the Cold War, there is no politician like John Kennedy that <unk> the hard and the dangerous, and there is no popular mythology of science fiction like the <unk> solar system.
In general, going to the moon turned out to be simple.
I was just three days.
And really, I wasn't even <unk> no problem.
We are alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be harder to get.
God knows that we don't lose the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start <unk> the <unk> ideas that have about confidence.
They're so common that they've become <unk> of our society.
I think it's three.
The first one is a <unk> there's been a great decline of trust, is a very widespread <unk>
The second is a goal: we should have more confidence.
And the third one is a <unk> we should regain confidence.
I think the <unk> the goal and the task have been <unk>
What I'm going to try and tell you today is a different story about a <unk> a goal and a task, which I think is a clearest idea about the subject.
First of all, why do people think that trust has <unk>
And if I think about the basis of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
It will bow me to think that it may have gone down in some activities or institutions and that might have increased others.
I don't have sure.
But I can turn it to opinion polls and look at the <unk> of the belief that trust has decreased.
When you look at the surveys of opinion over time, there are no many evidence of it.
I mean, the people who are <unk> 20 years ago, mostly journalists and politics, still <unk> the same <unk>
And the people who were very safe about 20 years ago, they continue to be pretty <unk> the nurses.
The rest of us in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly half of the road.
But this is really enough?
What <unk> polls are, of course, opinions.
What else can you <unk>
What you look at is the <unk> attitudes that people are doing when they are asked for certain questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if somebody told you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> on the <unk>
I probably asked for asking, "To do what?"
And that would be a very <unk> response.
And you might say, when you've answered your question, "Well, I trust you, but in some other no."
Which is very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to put trust in a <unk>
We don't assume that the confidence level that we're going to feel for a particular type of official or a type of person, it's going to be uniform in all cases.
I may, for example, I say I trust a certain teacher in elementary school that I know to give you the classroom, but no way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my friend more <unk> to keep a conversation, but no, maybe, to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we've got those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we let all of that knowledge all that knowledge when we think about trust in a more <unk> way.
I think these surveys are very bad tools to measure the real level of real confidence, because they try to <unk> the good inherent judgment of the fact that they have to trust something or somebody.
Secondly, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more confidence.
Frankly, I think it's a goal stupid.
It's not that the goal that I <unk>
I <unk> to have more confidence in what is <unk> of trust, but not what it is.
In short, I'm a <unk> of not to trust what is not reliable.
And I think that those people who were doing their savings with the very <unk> called Mr. <unk> that then disappeared with them, I think of them, and I think, well, yes, it was too <unk>
Having more confidence is not a smart goal in this life.
<unk> deposited or <unk> with intelligence, that's the right target.
Once you say that, he says, yeah, OK, that means that what matters in the first place is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What is about doing a judgment on how trustworthy people in certain aspects.
And I think that we can do a trial, we are forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we found that one person is <unk> in <unk> commodities and is responsible and honest, then we'll have a very good reason for trusting it, because it's going to be worthy of confidence.
But if, on the contrary, they are not responsible for the contrary, we couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest, but not <unk> in them to get a letter to the <unk> because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very sure that you can do some things, but I see that I would see their own <unk>
And I'm happy to say that I think I don't have a lot of friends who are conscious, and responsible for but extremely <unk>
If it's like that, I still haven't <unk>
But that's what we are <unk> to take on before confidence.
<unk> is the answer.
<unk> is what we have to <unk>
And of course, it's hard.
In the last decades, we've tried to build systems of accountability for all kinds of institutions, professional officials and so forth, that make us easier to judge their trustworthiness.
A lot of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work like <unk>
I remember once I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you see the problem is that it takes longer time to make the <unk> that <unk> <unk>
And we found the same problem in all of our public life, and we found that the system of accountability that is destined to ensure the <unk> and evidence for <unk> is actually doing the opposite.
What they do is they <unk> the work of people who have to do hard work like the <unk> <unk> that we <unk> the <unk> as we say.
You may have all of you know the similar examples.
We get all of that, for the goal.
I think that the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if we think about being worthy of trust, and we give them to the people that are trustworthy and if we try to figure out if other people, officials or politicians are worthy of confidence.
It's not easy. It's the trial, the simple actions <unk> what it doesn't do properly.
Third, the task.
It <unk> the task to reconstruct the trust, puts things backwards.
It suggests that you and I should reconstruct the confidence.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can reconstruct a little bit reliability.
We can do it if you're two people, trying to improve the confidence.
But the trust, ultimately, it's signature because they give them other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you to.
You have to give the base of enough for you to trust you.
You have to be worthy of confidence.
And that, of course, is because you can't <unk> all of all people, all the time.
But you also have to bring <unk> evidence that you are worthy of confidence.
How do you do it?
That is done every day, everywhere, the common people, the <unk> the institutions, very effectively.
I'll give you a simple commercial example.
The store where I buy my socks to say is that I can <unk> without giving explanations anymore.
I get them and get it back into the money, or they get them out of the color that I want.
That's nice. I rely on them because they themselves became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a great lesson on that.
If you become vulnerable to the other side, that's a very good test that you are worthy of trust, and you have trust what you're saying.
So in the end, I think what we're pointing is not very difficult to <unk>
What people trust is in relationships, and in that framework, they can determine when and how the other person is worthy of confidence.
Thank you.
Since the beginning of computers have been <unk> by reducing the separation between us and digital information, the separation between our material world and the world on the screen that the imagination can be <unk>
This separation has been increasingly <unk> and more and more, to maybe it's less than one millimeter, the thickness of the glass of a glass screen, and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone.
But I ask myself, and if I didn't have <unk>
I started to imagine how to <unk>
I first created this tool that goes into digital space, so that when the strong <unk> against the screen transfers its physical body <unk>
Designers can <unk> their ideas directly into 3D, and surgeons can practice virtual organs underneath the screen.
So with this tool that is cut the booms.
But the two hands remain out of the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with digital information using the whole dexterity of the hands?
In the Science <unk> division of Microsoft, with my mentor <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a little space on the keyboard in a labor area of work.
<unk> a bombsight transparent with chambers of depth cameras to detect the fingers and the face, now you can lift the <unk> of the keyboard, to get inside of the 3D space, and grab the pixels directly with your hands.
As the windows and archives have a location in real space, <unk> it's as easy as grab a book of a <unk>
You can flip through the book and put up lines or words with the virtual touch sensor that there is the bottom of every floating screen.
The architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with hands.
In these examples, we <unk> in the digital world.
And if we invest the roles and make digital information come towards us?
<unk> many of us would have bought and <unk> things on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device mounted on your head or <unk> when the system does understand the geometry of your body.
If we took this idea further, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in space, how can we make physicists so that we can <unk> and <unk>
What would a future like this?
At the MIT Media Lab with my <unk> Hiroshi Ishii, and my collaborator <unk> Post, we created this only physical <unk>
This magnet <unk> behaves like a 3D pixel in space, which means that both the computer as users can move the object anywhere within this little three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was we <unk> gravity and control the movement through a combination of <unk> <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
And to digitally <unk> the object, we released it from the restrictions of time and space, which means that human movements can <unk> and go back and get it to be in the physical world.
You can teach physically <unk> and a distance and the famous shot of Michael Jordan, you can reproduce it as a physical reality that we want to.
The students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets, physics, and, unlike the monitors or textbooks of text, this is a real experience and palpable experience that you can play and feel.
But what is most fascinating to change the physical part of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our everyday physical activities.
As you can see, digital information is not just going to show us something but that will begin to act directly about us as part of the physical world around us without having to escape from our world.
We started the talk today talking about a barrier, but if you took that barrier, the only limit that's left is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was <unk> to become <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the <unk>
When I was in the first grade, the government wanted to <unk> to a school for the <unk> <unk>
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
After the <unk> the Cultural Revolution, they believed that there was just an accurate way to <unk> a safe work and <unk> work.
No matter whether the job would or not.
But my dream was to be an opera of Chinese opera, but my dream.
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
An opera singer must start <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to the opera school.
I even wrote to the director of the school and the <unk> of a radio show.
But no adult would give you the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Only my friends <unk> me, but they were kids, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15 years, I knew that it was too much more for train.
My dream is never <unk>
<unk> that for the rest of my life a second class happiness is all the only thing you could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I decided to look for another <unk>
No one I wanted to do is <unk> OK.
I went to the books.
<unk> <unk> from <unk> <unk> my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and what the first books were here?
Those who were <unk> in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> is about life <unk>
And it's not <unk> <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but weird stuff.
That's a topic for another day.
But the fifth commandment of me was a <unk> <unk> to your father and your mother."
<unk> I told myself, "It's so different, and so much better than it is.
So it became my tool to get out of this <unk> <unk> and to reset the relationship with my parents.
The encounter with a new culture also gave place to my reading <unk>
<unk> a lot of perspectives.
For example, at the beginning this map seemed to me out of place because this is what students in China learn.
It had occurred to me that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves people's perspective.
The comparative reading is not something new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There are even some research camps like religion and comparative literature.
<unk> and <unk> offers the academic understanding of a subject.
And I thought that if the comparative reading was worked for research, why not do it as well in life <unk>
So I started reading books from two.
They can be <unk> <unk> from Walter <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from David <unk> who were involved in a same <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
For <unk> <unk> are economic <unk>
By Buddha, they are all <unk> lust, fear and <unk> <unk>
If you know another language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
<unk> the way of <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Instead of missing in the translation, I found that you can get a lot of it.
For example, it's through the translation that I realized that <unk> in Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
The books opened me a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know I'm not going to be happy or powerless ever.
Having a <unk> dream is really nothing compared to what many others have been <unk>
I've come to believe that the realization is not the only purpose of a dream.
Their most important purpose is to connect with the place that the dreams come from, where the passion, where your passion comes from.
Until a <unk> dream can do that for you.
And that's because of the books, that I'm here, happy, living again with purpose and clearly, most of the time.
So the books always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first customer <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in medical psychology, at Berkeley.
She was a <unk> woman called <unk>
Alex went into the first session using jeans and a <unk> <unk> stepped off on my office <unk> and he said he wanted to talk about his problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My partner <unk> had a <unk> as a <unk>
And I had a <unk> who wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could manage it.
But I didn't do it.
With the <unk> stories that Alex brought to the <unk> it was made me easy just to move the head while it was <unk>
<unk> are the new <unk> said Alex, and so I saw her, she was right.
You start to work afterwards, you get home later, it has children later, until the death goes later.
For women like Alex and I had time for a lot of time.
But soon after, my <unk> led me to press Alex who would talk about his life <unk>
I was <unk>
I said, "Yeah, he's coming up with guys underneath his category, <unk> with a <unk> head, but it's not like it was to marry him."
And then my <unk> said, "No, no, but maybe it gets <unk> with the next.
In addition, the best time to work on the marriage of Alex is before they <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized that the <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people feel head after what they were <unk> but this didn't cause the <unk> of Alex to be a pause in their development.
This made the <unk> of Alex to be the perfect moment and we were <unk>
So I realized, that this kind of <unk> <unk> was a real problem and had real consequences, not only for Alex and his loving life, but for careers, and the future of <unk> <unk>
There's 50 million <unk> in the United States today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if they think no one gets to the age of adulthood without going to be before the <unk>
Hands up if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk> in here.
Oh, Yes! You're amazing.
If you work with <unk> they love a <unk> you take care of your dream a <unk> I want to see it. It's okay.
This is not just my opinion. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will happen to be 35 years old.
This means eight of every 10 decisions and experiences and moments -- that gives you a way to your life that you will have happened to when you have 30 and <unk>
People of 40, don't go to panic.
This audience is going to be good, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a race have an exponential impact on the amount of money that we <unk>
We know that more than half of the Americans are married, they live in their own future couple at 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up and the last stage of growth in their <unk> and <unk> for <unk> which means that if there is something you want to change themselves, now it's time to change it.
We know that the personality changes more times during their <unk> than at any time of life, and we know that the female fertility comes up to its top to 28 and things become complicated to the <unk>
<unk> are the moment for <unk> on their body and their options.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years is crucial for language and attachment to the brain.
It's a moment in which its everyday life has an impact on the person who is <unk>
But what we don't hear often is that there is something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what the <unk> are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes in the line of <unk>
researchers call the <unk> an extended adolescence.
<unk> <unk> <unk> names like <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we have considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines the <unk>
Leonard Leonard <unk> said that to get great things, you need a plan and not enough time.
It's not it?
What do you think happens when you give a <unk> in your head, and they say, "You have another 10 years to start your <unk>
Nothing happens.
They stole that person's sense of urgency and ambition and ambition and nothing absolutely nothing.
And then every day, all the smart people like you or their kids and daughters get to my office and say something like this: "I know that my boyfriend, is not good for me, but this relationship. I'm just killing time."
Or they say, "Everybody says that while starting a career before the 30, everything will be okay."
But then it starts to sound something like this: "My <unk> are for <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I had better studies on the day I graduated from <unk>
And then it starts to sound something like this: "My quotes during the <unk> were like the game play.
They were all running, but it was <unk> but at some point around the 30, he turned out the music and everyone started to sit down.
I didn't want to be the only one who was standing there, so I sometimes think I married my husband because he was the nearest chair.
Where are the <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little bit end, but not <unk> the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for the <unk> there's a huge amount of pressure on the <unk> and so many of you start a career -- to choose a city, to choose a couple, and have two or three children in a long period of time.
And so many of these things are not <unk> and there is some research that you start to show, which is much harder and spirit to do everything once in the <unk>
The middle-aged crisis is not about buying red cars.
It's about realizing that you can't have the career you want you now.
<unk> you can't have the son that you want to do now, or you can't give a brother to your son.
A lot of <unk> and <unk> you see themselves.
I want to change what the <unk> are doing and thinking.
Here is a story about how it might be.
It's a story about a woman called <unk>
At 25, Emma came to my office because it was, in his own words, having an identity crisis.
He said he would like to work in art or in entertainment, but he was still couldn't decide, so I spent the last years working as a <unk>
As it was cheaper, she was living with a boyfriend, who showed more <unk> than ambition.
And despite living some very difficult <unk> his previous life had been even more difficult.
<unk> often in our <unk> but then they would wake up with it as you say, "You don't choose your family, but you can choose your friends."
Well, one day, Emma got his head on his legs and cried for almost the time.
I had just bought a new book book for <unk> and I had spent the entire morning <unk> with his many <unk> but then he was watching the empty space that follows after the <unk> <unk> please call <unk> please call <unk>
I was about to the <unk> when he saw me and said, "Who is going to be for me if I have a <unk> accident.
Who is going to take care of me if I give me <unk>
At that time, it took me a lot of work to resist and I don't say, <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> that really <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew that this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as well as the decade <unk> of Emma went ahead.
So over the next few weeks, and months, I told Emma three things that all <unk> man or woman, deserves to know.
First of all, I told Emma that <unk> that identity crisis, and <unk> capital capital.
For identity, I mean to do something that adds value to your person.
Doing something that you want to be later.
I didn't know the future of <unk> and nobody knows the future of work, but I know about it: identity capital generates capital of identity.
So now it's time for that work from the other side of the country, from that company that they want to give it a try.
I'm not <unk> <unk> exploration, I'm <unk> the exploration that should not count, which by the way, is not exploration, by the way, it's not exploration, by the way, it's not exploration, by the way.
It's <unk>
I told Emma that would explore jobs and make it count.
Second, I told Emma that the urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to take you to the airport, but the <unk> that come with friends with friends with the similar minds are limited in terms of who you know what you know -- how they talk, and where they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person who has to go out almost always comes from their closest circle.
The new things come from what they call the weak links friends of their friends.
Yes, half the <unk> have a bad job or they don't have work.
But the other half won't, and the weak bonds are the way we <unk> this group.
Half of the jobs that I did have never been <unk> then to know the chief of your neighbor is the way to get a <unk> work.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information is happening.
Last but not least, Emma believed that you don't choose your family, but I know your friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but as a <unk> Emma would soon go to his family when they have a partner and form their own family.
I told Emma that the time to choose his family had come.
You might think the 30 is better and better and even 25 or even 25 and I agree with you.
But to choose the person that you live right now or you get <unk> now when everyone on Facebook starts to walk toward <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you have, and that means being so <unk> in love as you're at the workplace.
<unk> your family must be a conscious choice of who and what they want instead of just going to do it will work or kill you to be able to be going to be going to be going to be going to be going to be <unk>
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found the <unk> of a <unk> who worked at a art museum in another state.
This weak bond helped him get a work there.
That work of work gave a reason to leave the boyfriend, that she alive.
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special events in museums.
This married one man who chose <unk>
<unk> his new career, he loves his new family, and I send me a letter to me, "Now the room of contacts room are not quite <unk>
The story of Emma may sound easy, but that's what I love to work with <unk>
It's very easy to help them.
<unk> are like airplanes who come from the L.A. airport that goes somewhere from the West.
Just before the <unk> a slight fit in its trajectory makes the difference between land or in <unk>
In the same way, at the same way, or the 25 and even <unk> a good conversation, a good TED Talk -- a good TED Talk can have huge effects in the next few years or even in the following generations.
Here is my idea worth of spreading all the <unk> you know.
It's as simple as what I learned to say to <unk>
It's what I now have the privilege of telling <unk> like Emma every day: <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get an identity capital, using their <unk> bonds -- using your family <unk> you choose your family.
Don't let me define what they didn't know or what they didn't do.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very hard job in management <unk> for a work that was even more <unk> the <unk>
I went to teach you mathematics to graduate students in New York City schools.
And as any professor, I applied tests and tests.
Let me give you assignments.
When I work back, <unk> grades.
What struck me was that <unk> wasn't the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of those who had a better performance had no I.Q. scores had <unk>
Some of my smartest children were not going so well.
And that set me thinking.
The kind of things that you need to learn in mathematics in seventh grade, sure, are <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and I was very convinced that each of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and during time enough.
After several years more than <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a <unk> perspective, from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure better way.
It's the <unk> but what if you're successful in school and life depends on a lot more than the ability to learn in a quick way, and that easy?
So I left the classroom and I went to college to become <unk>
I started studying kids and adults at all kinds of <unk> <unk> and every study my question was, who's successful here and why?
My research team and I went to the Academy <unk> West <unk>
And we tried to predict what <unk> <unk> in military training.
We went to the National <unk> of <unk> and we tried to predict what children would do as far as we could have the competition.
We studied professors who are working on working in really difficult neighborhoods -- what teachers still will be teaching for the end of the school year and <unk> who will be the most effective in improving the learning results of their <unk>
We teamed up with private enterprises, asking yourself, which of these <unk> are going to keep their <unk>
What is going to make more money?
In all those very different contexts, emerged a feature as an important success of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, the physical health and it wasn't <unk>
It was <unk>
<unk> is passion and <unk> to achieve very long-term goals.
<unk> is to have a resistance.
<unk> is embracing your future, day after day, not only for the week, not only for the month, but for years and working really hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is to live life as if it was a <unk> not a race.
A few years ago, I started studying determination in public schools from Chicago.
I asked the thousands of high school students that did my <unk> questionnaires and then waited for more than a year to see the people who are <unk>
It turns out that the children with more determination had significantly greater likely to <unk> even when they <unk> them in every feature that I could measure, things like family income, the results of <unk> testing even the security results that they were in school.
So it's not only in West Point, or in the National <unk> <unk> where <unk> matters is also in school, especially for children at risk of <unk>
For me, the most shocking thing about determination is how little we know, how little we know, the science of its development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do the determination of <unk>
What do I have to do to show kids a solid <unk>
How do we keep them motivated for the long <unk>
The most honest answer is, I don't know.  What I know is that talent doesn't give them purpose.
Our data shows very clearly that there are many talented individuals who just don't go ahead with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, the absolute determination is not related or it is even related to the talent.
So far, the best idea I've heard about develop the determination of the children is something called <unk> <unk>
This is an idea developed at Stanford University for Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, that it can change with the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grow to the challenge, they are much more likely to be able to get them out, because they don't believe that failure.
So the growth of growth is a great idea to develop purpose.
But we need more.
And that's where I finish my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have to go ahead.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions and we need to <unk>
We need to measure if you've been successful, and we need to be willing to fail, to try and start to start everything again with the <unk>
In other words, we need to be certain about making our children more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan like the daughter of a <unk> one of my most <unk> memories is my mother <unk> the beauty and the shape of the Chinese characters.
Since that moment, I was <unk> by this incredible language.
But for a overseas, it seems to be as <unk> as the Great Wall of China.
Over the last few years, I've been wondering if I can put it down this <unk> so that whoever you want to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language I can do it.
I started thinking about how a new method and quickly learning Chinese could be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw every single character of every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Since we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and simple way.
One Chinese academic <unk> 20 thousand characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic literacy ...
The first 200 will allow them to understand about 40 percent of the basic literature, enough enough to read <unk> <unk> <unk> understanding the basic idea of websites or the paper.
Today I start with eight to show you how the method.
Are you ready?
Open your mouth as much as possible until it is <unk>
They get a mouth.
This is a person who is going to give a ride.
<unk>
If the fire form is a person with arms in both sides, as if I was shouting at the <unk> <unk> I am <unk> This symbol is actually <unk> in the form of called, but I like to believe that it is the other way.
This is a tree.
tree tree.
This is a mountain.
<unk>
The moon.
The <unk> symbol looks like a couple of gates of a <unk> in the old West.
I call it <unk> to these eight characters.
They are building blocks to make a lot more characters.
One person.
If someone walks back, that's <unk>
As the old man said, two are company, three are crowd.
If one person stretch their arms, this person is saying to <unk> that big.
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a <unk> such as <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is a tree. Two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a table under the tree, we have the foundations base.
Put a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk>  <unk> to remember, because a loudspeaker tree is quite an idiot.
Remember you remember it.
Two wheels together, it's very hot.
Three <unk> together, that's a lot of flames.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the moon shining together, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and night.
The sun comes out on the horizon.
One door. You put a board on the door, it's the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, asking questions.
<unk> had somebody at home?
This person is coming out hidden in a gate, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're <unk>
Three women together, be careful about <unk>
So we've already spent about 30 characters.
By using this method, the first eight radical eight will allow them to build 32.
The next eight characters of eight characters will build another 32.
So with every little effort, you will be able to learn a couple of hundreds of characters, which is the same thing that learns a Chinese in eight years.
So after knowing the characters, we started to create sentences.
For example, the mountain and the fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know Japan is the land of the <unk> sun.
This is a sun placed with the <unk> because Japan is in China.
So a sun next to the background, we created Japan.
A person behind Japan, what do we do that?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left is two mountains stacked over the other.
In the old China, that meant in exile, because the Chinese <unk> <unk> their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, the exile has become out.
A mouth that tells you to go out is a <unk>
This is a slide to remind me that I must stop talking and go down the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be my dad is the movies I come to see.
I love to share my favorite movies with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the Monterey magician together.
The film took his imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave him a good excuse to use a bright dress.
But when you look at that film so many times, you get to understand that it's remarkable.
We now live and raise our children in a kind of industrial complex of child fantasy <unk>
However, the magician of Oz was a event in itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend really took rise to the extra years later with, interestingly, another film whose <unk> a metal boy and a <unk> kid <unk> a girl in the enemy.
You know what I'm talking about?  Yes.
There's a great difference between these two films, there's a couple of big differences between the Oz of Oz and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there is very little violence in the magician of <unk>
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like <unk>
But I think if the magician of Oz is done today, the magician would say, <unk> you're the salvation of Oz as the prophecy.
<unk> magic shoes to defeat the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another one of the <unk> magician is that the most <unk> characters and even <unk> are women.
I started noticing this when I did see "Star <unk> my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At that moment, I also had a son.
three years old.
It wasn't invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the education level had <unk>  So I was so slid in the room and I was impressed as a mom left with his <unk> behind, and I don't think he understood what was going on, but <unk> <unk> everything.
I wonder what <unk>
Would you be <unk> <unk> and <unk>
It would feel that Luke you have an army to <unk> to <unk>
<unk> this with the magician of Oz in <unk>
How was Dorothy his film?
We do good <unk> with all and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my kids to grow to them, OK?
Why is there so much rough capital <unk> force in the movies for our kids, and so little out of the way of brick <unk>
There's a lot of literature about the impact of men's violence in male violence in the girls, and they should be <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this encouragement.
I know by experience that Princess <unk> does not provide the proper framework that would have served it in order to navigate the world of adults who are <unk>  I think at the moment of the first <unk> I really expected that the credits started to come up because it's the end of the film, right?
My search is finished, I have <unk>
Why are you standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
The movies are focused on <unk> and getting their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like a child, you have to be an <unk> animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk>
There are lots of exceptions, and to defend the <unk> of Disney to any of you.
But they send a message to the kids, but you guys are not really their goal.
They do a phenomenal job teaching girls how to fight against the <unk> but they don't necessarily show kids how to defend the <unk>
There's no model for them.
We also have some great women who write new stories for our kids, as real and lovely as <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being a war movies.
Of course, the most successful topic of all time continues to be appearing by classic after classic each of them on the adventures of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and their son, or two men who raised a little girl.
Until many of you are thinking, this year, eventually came out <unk>
I recommend all of you. It's already available in stores.
Remember what the criticism said when he came out to <unk>
I can't believe that Pixar has made a movie of a <unk>
It's very good. Don't let it get the <unk>
Well, almost no of these movies passed the test of <unk>
I don't know if you've heard of this.
It's still not being <unk> and it is still <unk> but maybe we will start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic book book -- and in the <unk> I recorded a conversation that had had a friend on the assessment of the movies that you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that you must <unk> in the film, more than a female character that has lines?
So, you have to do the <unk>
These women talk to each other at some point in the movie?
Their conversations are about something else from the guy that you like to do --    Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Two women that exist and they talk about things each other.
<unk> I've seen, and yet very rarely I see it in the cinema that we know and love.
In fact, this week I went to see a very good quality, <unk> movie.
Right? It <unk> from <unk> success -- a sense of consensus from what a Hollywood quality movie movie <unk>
<unk> not the test of <unk>
And I don't think that <unk> because a lot of the film, I don't know if you've seen it, a lot of the film happens in a embassy where men and women are hiding during the <unk> crisis.
We have many scenes of men who have deep and painful conversations in this <unk> and it's the great time for one of the actors to take a look at the door, and say, <unk> to bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So let's focus on the numbers.
In 2011, of the 100 most popular movies how many of them believe they have actors <unk>
<unk> Not bad.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women that we have chosen for Congress, so it's okay.
But there is a larger number that this room is going to be <unk> this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what he would say.
One in the United States, one in five women says that it has been sexually transmitted in his life.
I don't think of mass entertainment.
I don't think that movies for children have something to do with that.
I don't believe that videos of music or <unk> are closely <unk> but something is wrong, and when I hear that statistics, one of the things that I think is that there's a huge amount of sex.
Who are those <unk> What are they <unk>
What do you get <unk>
They're <unk> the history of a male hero is to defeat the <unk> with violence and then charge the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we find this world and this very startling statistic and we want to <unk>
We have tools for our <unk> as a <unk> <unk> and we hope that that <unk> but I have to ask, <unk> <unk> is going to <unk> if, at the same time, active or <unk> we are educating our children so that they keep their power <unk>
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean mainly by parents.
I think we have to show our children male to a new definition of <unk>
The definition of the masculinity is radically changing radically.
You've read about how the new economy is changing the role of the home and the <unk>
Everything is changing.
When I asked my daughter what his favorite favorite character of "Star <unk> you know what they <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What's in common these two?
Maybe it's not just the brilliant dress.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those movies that you know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to <unk> to reach their potential.
They're leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want fewer stories that I would say to my <unk> Go and fight only and more stories where their job is to join a team, maybe a team led by women, to help other people improve and be better people, like the magician of <unk>
Thank you.
As a little girl, I was living in Maine and one of the things that I was like, I was looking for a lot of sea cookies on the shores of Maine because my parents told me that that would be luck.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're covered in sand, and it's hard to see them.
And yet, over time, I went to <unk>
I started to see shapes and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in a love for the past and <unk>
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized that I saw my own eyes wasn't enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up to one of 3,000 miles of length along with the <unk>
And my sea cookies had grown up to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite imagery.
To try to make a map of the past, I knew I had to see in another way.
I want to show you an example of how different we see the <unk>
This is a place in the eastern Delta. of Egypt called <unk>
And the place, it seems like it's brown, but when we use infrared and process it using fake color, suddenly the place looks like pink pink <unk>
What you're looking at is the real chemical changes of the <unk> of the <unk> materials and the activities of the ancient Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we have used satellite data to find an old city, called <unk> lost for thousands of years.
<unk> was the capital of the ancient Egypt for more than 400 years ago called the Middle Empire about 4,000 years ago.
The place is in the <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle Empire, there was this great renaissance of the ancient art and architecture and religion.
<unk> have always known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that <unk> <unk> within the red circles, but somewhere within this enormous <unk> <unk>
This area is huge, it's about <unk> per mile away.
Before, the Nile <unk> right next to <unk> and as it changed over time, it moved to the time and covered the entire city.
So how do you find a city <unk> in a <unk> landscape.
And I will try to find in the random of the equivalent of a needle in a <unk> with your eyes, and using baseball <unk>
So we use <unk> data to make a map of place, with very subtle changes.
So we were able to see where we would get the <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this area slightly <unk> that you see inside the circle here, which we think could be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with the scientists who are doing <unk> work, you can see it here.
When I say <unk> it's like the shots of sample on ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we look for layers of human <unk>
Five meters down, underneath a thick layer of <unk> we found a dense layer of objects of <unk>
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five meters down, we have a layer of occupation of a number of hundreds of years that date from the Ottoman Empire and exactly the same period that we think is <unk>
We also found <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> which proves that there was a <unk> shop there.
This might seem that it's not a lot, but when we think of the most common stones for the <unk> of the Middle Empire, these are the stones that are <unk>
So we have a dense <unk> of occupation that goes back from the Middle Empire.
We also have evidence of a elite elite <unk> which proves that what has been there, was a very important city.
We still don't find <unk> here, but <unk> the place in a near future.
Even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so that they can also make great discoveries.
I want to end with my favorite quote from the Ottoman Empire and it was probably written in <unk> 4,000 years ago.
So share knowledge is the greatest of all <unk>
There's nothing like that on land.
So according to TED was not founded in 1984 <unk>
<unk> that ideas actually started in 1984 B.C. <unk> in a lost city not for a lot of time and found from the high.
It certainly puts <unk> for <unk> in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to invite your eyes.
Imagine outside, front of the door of <unk> home.
I want you to pay attention to the door, the stuff that is made.
Now we <unk> a bunch of obese <unk>
They are competing with a bicycle <unk> and they go in the direction of their <unk>
I need you to see this <unk>
They're <unk> strong, they're <unk> they are <unk>
And they collide from their home.
There are bikes and flying around everywhere, wheels that go on on their side, the rays that end up in <unk> places -- the summit threshold.
By the <unk> or what there is on the other side of the door, and the quality of the light, and the light is shining down on the <unk> of the <unk>
<unk> <unk>
From his chair over a brown horse on a brown horse.
It's a horse that he speech.
You can feel your blue <unk> <unk> <unk> on your nose.
You can smell the <unk> cookie.
<unk> on one side and enter his living room.
It's already in the room, and making maximum use of his imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
It's with little laundry and dancing over his center, a center, singing <unk>  One More <unk>
Now you get to the kitchen.
The ground has been coated with a way of yellow <unk> and from the oven coming towards you -- the Man of the <unk> the <unk> and the <unk> of "The Wizard of <unk> <unk> of the hands, sort of skipping toward you.
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a peculiar contest that takes place every spring in New York.
It's called the <unk> of <unk>
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a <unk> journalist, I guess, that this was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few <unk> ladies and different habits of hygiene.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers -- they were looking at them just once.
They <unk> the names of dozens and dozens of strangers.
We get entire poems in only minutes.
<unk> to see who he could memorize as quickly the order of a deck of <unk>
And I was thinking, "This is <unk>
These people must be phenomena of nature.
And I started talking with some of the competitors.
This is a man named Ed <unk> who had come from England and has one of the best <unk> <unk>
I asked her, <unk> when you realized that you were a <unk>
Ed replied, "I'm not a wise.
Actually, I have an average memory.
Everybody involved in this competition is that they have normal memory.
"We have been trained to perform these miracle acts of memory using some old techniques invented a half thousand years ago in Greece, the same techniques that I used to use <unk> to memorize their speakers, and that the <unk> used to memorize <unk>
And my reaction was, <unk> How did I have no ear of this <unk>
We were standing out of the hall of competition, and <unk> who is a wonderful English and brilliant one, although a little <unk> told me, <unk> you are an American journalist.
You meet Britney <unk>
And I said, "What?" No, why?
Because I would like to teach Britney <unk> how to memorize the order on a deck of <unk> live on national TV.
That will prove to the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me me.
I mean, you have to start by something not?"
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
And I ended up the majority of the next year not just training my memory, but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work and what their potential.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a guy called <unk>
He's <unk> very probably with the worst memory in the world.
His memory was so bad that I didn't even remember that I had a problem of <unk> it's awesome.
Somebody who was incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allowed us to see to what extent our memory is about us who we are.
At the other end of the spectrum, I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> He was based on the paper of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk> <unk>
We passed a afternoon together in the public library in Salt Lake City, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And to come back, I read a number of treaties on memory about a little over 2,000 years ago in Latin, in the <unk> and then in the Dark Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time when this idea of having a disciplined and disciplined and <unk> was not a thing as rare as it might be like today.
A long time ago, people invest in their memory, they will provide their minds.
These techniques have made our modern world, but also have changed us.
We have changed the <unk> and I would argue that they have changed our <unk>
As we have no need to remember, sometimes it seems like we have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where is still really passionate about this idea of a disciplined and disciplined memory -- is this competition so unique of memory.
It's actually not so <unk> there are <unk> there are <unk>
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a research group at University College in London invited a memory group to the lab.
They wanted to know -- it's going to have brains in a certain way, or <unk> different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
They're more intelligent than the <unk>
They gave them a cognitive test battery and the answer was actually not.
There was yet a really interesting difference and significant difference between the brains of memory champions and the subjects of control with the <unk>
When they put them on a MRI MRI machine, <unk> their brains while <unk> numbers, faces and forms of snow -- they found that in the memory champions they get different parts of the brain, different parts of the brain, different to others.
They actually <unk> or they looked like a part of the brain that involves spatial and navigation.
Why? There's something we can learn from this?
The tournament of <unk> competitive is driving as an armed career where each year comes with a new way of remembering more things, more quickly, and then the rest of the competitors must get a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times <unk>
On his desk, in front of him, there is 36 <unk> of <unk> cards that he's about to try to memorize an hour, using a technique that he invented and just he <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of <unk> digits <unk>
<unk> Yes.
And as there is a huge amount of ways to remember things in these <unk> absolutely all the techniques that are used by the end, you get down to a single concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
It illustrates with a fancy paradox known as the paradox <unk> <unk> <unk> the following. I tell two people who remember the same word, I tell you to you, there's a guy called <unk>
That's his <unk>
And then I ask you, <unk> there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I come back later, and I asked them to <unk> that word I told you a <unk>
<unk> which <unk>
The person who said that his name is <unk> is unlikely to remember the same word than the person who said that his job is <unk>
The same word, different capacity of <unk> that's weird.
What is it here?
Well, the name ridge actually doesn't mean nothing for you. It doesn't have any relationship anymore.
And with all the other memories that dance on their head.
But the word, <unk> We know <unk>
They use <unk> <unk>
They have <unk>
They worked well when they come home to work.
You probably have some <unk>
And when you get that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> at some point after that.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this two billion years ago in Ancient Greece <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of <unk>
The story says this: There was a poet called <unk> which I attended a <unk>
They had been hired as entertainment, because before, if I wanted to give a very good party, you didn't bring a <unk> to a <unk> <unk>
He stood up with his <unk> <unk> and he <unk> and so soon it was the room of the <unk> <unk>
Let's get all of us.
But not just killed all of them all, but it shattered the <unk> <unk>
No one could say who was there, nobody could remember where they were sitting.
So you couldn't get the <unk>
A tragedy behind the other.
He stopped standing outside, only survivor, in the rubble, closed the eyes and realized that with the eyes of his mind, I could see where he had been sitting every day.
He took the family of the hand <unk> where their loved ones were in the rubble.
What <unk> <unk> at that moment is something that we all know about more or less <unk> and it is that no matter if we are not good to remember names or telephone numbers, or word instructions for the word of our colleagues, we have visual memory and <unk>
If I asked them to <unk> the first 10 words of the story that I just told you about <unk> you are very likely to get it very hard to do it.
But I would bet if you asked them to say who was sitting on the horse on the brown speaker in his <unk> they would be able to <unk>
The idea of the memory of the memory is to create this building with the eyes of your mind and <unk> of images with the things that you want to remember -- the <unk> and crazy -- and <unk> and <unk> and <unk> is the most <unk> thing to be.
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years, to the first treated of memory, in <unk>
And how does it work?
Let's say that you have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and you want to make it memory, the same way that I would have done it, if you had invited it to <unk> 2,000 years ago.
What you might do is imagine that they're at the door of your house.
And to come up with some kind of an absolutely ridiculous, crazy image and crazy to help them remember that the first thing you want to mention is that <unk> competition.
And then you can imagine moving into your house, and see the <unk> of the <unk> over Mister <unk>
And you remember that you want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you would see Britney <unk> to remind you that funny anecdote that wants to count.
And then in the kitchen, and the fourth thing that would talk, would be that strange journey that did for a whole year, and they have some friends to help them to remember it.
This is how the speakers <unk> <unk> their speakers, no word by word, which is a typical <unk> <unk>
The term <unk> comes from the Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a remnant of when people thought about the <unk> and the rhetoric with this kind of spatial terms.
The phrase <unk> <unk> would be like the first place in his palace of memory.
I saw that this was just fascinating, and I jumped in full of that.
I went to some of these memory skills, and I had the idea of writing something big about this <unk> of competitive <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a <unk> event.
Seriously, it's like looking at a lot of people sitting around taking exams. I mean, the most exciting thing that happens is when someone is <unk> the front.
I'm a journalist, and I need to be able to write about something.
I know there are amazing things going on in the minds of these people, but I don't have access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put myself in place.
So I started spending 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before I sit at the New York Times just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an ancient <unk> school <unk>
And I discovered that this was entertaining.
I would never have expected it to do it.
It was fun, because it wasn't just to train the memory.
What is actually about doing is to improve increasingly the ability to create and imagine these images that are <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of the mind.
I was very excited about this.
This is me, using my standard training team for the memory competition.
It's a couple of <unk> and some security glasses covered with tape just leaving two <unk> because the distraction is the worst enemy of a memory <unk>
And I ended up coming back to the same competition that had been covered in a year before, and I had the idea that I could do it in a kind of <unk> experiment.
I thought this could be good for my whole research to do.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> which I didn't have to happen.
Of course it's nice to be able to memorize speakers, and mobile phone numbers, and you know, but actually this is not the point.
These are just <unk> <unk> that work.
Because they are based on very basic principles about how the brain works.
And you don't need to be able to build <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> to benefit from a little bit of insight, about how your mind.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was about a gift <unk> but it's not the case.
The great memories are <unk>
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
So let's focus on a deep time.
The palace of <unk> These memory techniques are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk>
They work because they make us <unk>
It turns out a kind of profound processing -- a kind of complete attention that most of you are not <unk> around.
But the reality is that there is no shortcuts.
This is how things are <unk>
And if there is something that I want to leave you with today, is what you <unk> the <unk> that I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, I let me come to me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose what our short existence is in the <unk> or the <unk> not by paying attention to the human in front of us, who walk on our side, we're going to be so <unk> that we don't even afford to process <unk>
I learned from the first hand that there are the capabilities of incredible memory that there are great <unk>
But if you want to live a <unk> life, you must be the kind of person that remembers remember.
Thank you.
I'm going to tell you about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex issue, so we just <unk> just a <unk> place, New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I am the <unk> I was six years old, and I lived there at my parents' home in a village called <unk> and this was my child's bedroom.
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom I shared with my sister.
And between my dorm room and the bathroom, there was a balcony that I gave the living room.
And there were all the time looking at the television TV, so every time I was going from my room to the bathroom -- all I had to see me and every time I grew up, and I would come back in a towel all of me.
And I was like that.
It was <unk> unsure and hated it.
<unk> that journey, hated that <unk> I hated that room and that house.
That's the architecture.
All right.
Those feelings, those emotions that I felt, that's the power of architecture, because architecture is not about math, nor about the division of areas but of those emotional <unk> that we feel in the places that we <unk>
And it's not surprising that we feel like that, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency --  Americans spend 90 percent of their time on roof.
I mean, 90 percent of the time are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
<unk> determines us in ways we don't even realize it.
That makes us some naive and very, very predictable.
This means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know they think about it, because it is based on a building that built a half a half thousand years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> that the architects use to create an emotional connection with the ways we build our buildings.
This is an emotional connection -- we've used this trick for a long, long time.
We used it 200 years ago to build banks.
We used it in the 19th century to build art museums.
And in the 20th century, in the U.S., we use it to build homes.
See, these stable stable, <unk> stable, <unk> in front of the elements.
This is really, really useful, because building stuff is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a lot of time and it's very complicated.
The people who <unk> <unk> and governments are always afraid of innovation, and they prefer to use ways that they know are going to work.
So we found out of buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
This is the Public Library of <unk> which was ended in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, he has a <unk> has this round thing -- and a red brick -- that you leave the red <unk> which is trying to communicate with this <unk> kids, the stock values -- history.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year in 2004, on the other side of the country, came in another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media in the digital era.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to come together, read and share.
So how is it possible in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both of the so-called libraries, are so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works on the beginning of the <unk>
On one side is <unk> architects constantly drives new technologies, new <unk> new solutions for today's life ways.
We were going to sort of <unk> and we gave them so much, that we move away from the people.
All of the black, this tells us, you think we feel very well, but we're dead because we have no option.
We need to go on the other side and go back to these <unk> symbols.
So we do that, and we are all happy, but we feel like <unk> so we started to experience <unk> we make swing the <unk> <unk> over and over and over again, and over again. So we've done it in the last 300 years, and of course we have done it in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago, <unk> in the 1970s.
The architects were busy experimenting with so-called <unk>
It has to do with concrete.
That can be guess.
<unk> small, <unk>
Really really hard.
So we are approaching the '80s, and we started to bring those symbols.
<unk> the <unk> one in the other direction.
We take those ways that we know that we like and <unk> them.
<unk> <unk> and we added <unk> and we use new materials.
They love it.
We don't give <unk>
We take <unk> <unk> and we turned them into skyscrapers that can be <unk> made out of glass.
The shapes is <unk> won at audacity and <unk>
<unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
It's crazy.
But it was the '80s, that's great.
We all spend the time in business centers, we moved to the neighborhoods, and there in the suburbs, we can create our own erotic <unk>
Those fantasies could be the <unk> of French or the Italian.
You may have a <unk> of bread.
This is what happens with the <unk>
This is what happens with the symbols.
They're easy -- they're cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, we recreating memories of other places.
I know very well, and you all know, that this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
Architects are feeling frustrated and we started making a swing from new in the other direction.
In the 1980s and early '90s, we started to experiment with the <unk>
<unk> the <unk> symbols now we have new design techniques of a computer, and we found new <unk> a little bit of ways that <unk> against other forms.
This is academic and <unk> and it's super <unk> You have totally <unk>
Normally, the pendulum <unk> in the opposite direction.
But then something <unk>
In 1997, this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building changed the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when critical and public critics in general, were completely <unk>
New York Times <unk> this building <unk>
<unk> for Bilbao is increased by a half thousand when they finished the building.
So all of a sudden, everybody wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Seattle, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everybody wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first star.
But how is it possible for these wild and wild ways, how we can become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because the media is <unk> around them, and we quickly learned that those forms meant culture and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these forms.
They did the world's greatest mayors in the world.
So everybody believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon of the beginning of the new <unk> country with other star.
And I went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few elite architects on the top of the new millennium, actually started to happen with all the architecture, digital media started to increase the speed of information consumption.
Think for example, how do you use architecture.
A thousand years ago, you would have to have walked to the next town to see a building.
The transport is <unk> they can take a boat, a plane, can be <unk>
<unk> technology. You can see in the newspapers, on TV, and in the end, we're all photographers from architecture, and the building is carried beyond its physical location.
The architecture is everywhere, that means that the speed of communications has finally reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture is moving so fast.
It doesn't really wait long to think about a building.
It takes a lot of time to build a building, three or four years old, and at that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 more buildings, before we knew if I designed four years ago it was a success or not.
Because there's never been good feedback in architecture.
This is how we find buildings like this.
The <unk> wasn't a <unk> movement.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much <unk>
That's never going to happen to happen. Because we are at the top of the largest revolution in architecture from the invention of the steel or the <unk> and it's the media revolution.
My theory is that when you apply to media, it starts to swing faster and faster, until you get to be in both extremes almost in <unk> and actually actually the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, the architects, and you, the architects, and you guys, the architects, and you guys, the public.
Now we can make symbols almost <unk> with emotional charge of something completely new.
Let me show you how the system works on a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> <unk> in the state of New York City.
It's a vacation.
But that meant that two years before the building, was already part of the community, and as the drawings looked exactly the way that they finished, there was no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community. That first summer, when people started coming into it, and sharing it in social media, the building stopped being a building, it became a means of communication, because these are not only images of a building, are the images that you did from the building.
And as you use it to tell your story, they become part of the personal narrative, and that makes the collective memory, and when you carry these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks to tell us how to think about architecture.
We can tell each other what we think of architecture, because digital media hasn't changed the relationship between us, but have changed the relationship between us and buildings.
Think for a second in the librarians of <unk>
If that building was built today, first <unk> to the Internet for <unk> <unk>
We were bombarded with examples of <unk> innovation, what might be a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that can lead to the mayor of <unk> to people in <unk> and tell you that there is no single answer to what a library can be today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives the freedom to experience.
Everything is different now.
The architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that use <unk> words and simple, and you are no longer a <unk> audience that doesn't embrace anything I haven't seen before.
The architects can listen, and you don't stop being <unk> by architecture.
That means that the pendulum <unk> from a way to the other, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find right solutions to the problems facing the society.
This is the end of the history of architecture, and it means that the buildings in the morning will be very different from the buildings today.
This means that a public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be only and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn, can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad <unk> historic brick of <unk> red brick based on ideas of what a <unk> must be.
This means that some robots will be able to build our buildings, because we will ultimately be ready for the ways that will produce.
That means that the buildings are attached to the whims of nature and not the reverse.
This means that a parking little garage in <unk> <unk> Florida, it can also serve to make a sport or to <unk> or even you can get married there at night.
This means three architects can dream at the East <unk> East of New York City, and raising a half million dollars from the community that are all around that cause, it's not a customer alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little <unk> pavilion, and <unk> and <unk> like the animals that are going to observe.
Because no matter if it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how to build it, what it matters is what we built.
The architects already know how to make new buildings more and more <unk>
We've been waiting for all of you to hear them.
Finally, we're not on the opposite side.
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot of play.
The buildings not only reflect our society, but they give them to the <unk> spaces, the local libraries -- the homes where we form our kids, and the step of the bedroom.
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned a year and started walking.
And it makes it very very typical of the typical children of a year, <unk> as if his body was moving too fast for his legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that you like to do for the moment is look in the mirror.
She really loves his reflection.
It's laughing and <unk> and it gives itself these big <unk> and <unk>
It's beautiful.
And apparently, all his friends do this and my mom realize that I used to do it, and he asked me to think, when's I going to do this?
How do we suddenly be comfortable with our <unk>
Because, apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking for <unk> "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> it's 13 and lives in <unk>
And as any teenager just wants to be dear and fit in.
It's Sunday night.
It's preparing for the next week in school.
It has a little bit of fear, it's a little confused because, even though his mom says it all the time that it's beautiful, every day in school, somebody says it's ugly.
Among what his mom says and what his friends, or <unk> they say, "You don't know who believe.
So a video of her himself, he publishes it on YouTube, and he asked others to please leave a <unk> "I'm a nice man, or I'm a <unk>
Well, so far, <unk> has got more than 13,000 comment.
Some of these are so <unk> that doesn't even deserve to think about them.
We talk about a normal <unk> normal teenager, which gets these answers from one of the most stages of their most vulnerable life.
Thousands of people are written like this, mostly in their most teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what is it going to do this?
Well, teenagers today are almost never alone.
They're under pressure of being online and available all the time, speaking, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> this is never ends.
We have never been so connected, in a continued way, so young people.
As a mother said, "It's like there's a party in his fourth <unk>
There's just no privacy.
And the social pressures that go from hand with that are <unk>
This environment, from being connected is <unk> our children to <unk> based on the number of likes that they have and the kinds of reviews that they do.
There's no division between a life online and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what it is true, or what it is.
And also, it's very hard to know the difference between what is authentic and what is <unk> digitally.
What is the most important thing in the life of someone in front of you, what is normal in a daily context.
And where are you looking for the <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> from the news of girls now.
<unk> from North feet. They continue to dominate our <unk>
The <unk> technique is now routine.
And trends like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those that <unk> it means <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in the popular culture of today.
It's not hard to do with the young people.
But kids aren't immune to this.
Like the <unk> stars of the sport, and the singers <unk>
But what is the problem with all this?
Well, we certainly want our children to grow healthy and be poor individuals.
But in a culture that's obsessed with the image, we're teaching our kids to spend more time and mental effort to their appearance, the price of all the other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical skills, their studies and other ways they start to be hurt.
Six in 10 girls would prefer to do something because they think they don't look enough enough.
These are not <unk>
They are fundamental activities for their growth as human beings and <unk> to society and the field of labor development.
31 percent, almost one of three teenagers are not interested in the classroom in class.
One of five are not attending at all the way during the days when you don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the tests, if you don't think that you see good enough -- specifically if you don't believe that you are thin, <unk> a lower note on the average of your classmates who don't care about it as appearance.
And this phenomenon has widespread in Finland, United States and China.
And then regardless of what they actually weigh these young people.
So to be clear of course, we are talking about how you see you -- not how you really are.
The low self-esteem of his body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk>
<unk> with little self-esteem are doing less physical activity, they eat less fruits and vegetables, participate in more diet not healthy that they can take them into a food <unk>
They have low self-esteem.
They are more easily <unk> by the people around them and they're at greatest risk of depression.
And we think that's all because of what they make more <unk> decisions like the consumption of alcohol and of drugs, diet <unk> surgery, <unk> sexual relations and no protection and harm damage.
The search for the perfect body is pushing into the healthcare system, and our government costs a billion dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who believe they are overweight again, regardless of whether they have or not have higher rates of <unk>
<unk> percent of women don't present to a job interview in a day that they don't feel safe with the way you see it.
Think about a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would be that <unk>
It takes this potential for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, by itself, doesn't take you very far.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key ways. The first is that we need to nurture trust in your own body.
We need to help our teenagers develop strategies to overcome the pressure of the perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are a lot of programs available to do that.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
And I was very amazed when I learned that a lot of <unk> programs didn't realize that situation.
So we need to make sure that the program that our children follow our children will not only have a positive impact, but also a <unk> impact.
And research studies show that the best programs focused on six key areas. The first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six aspects are critical points for anyone willing to provide education on your body self-esteem that works.
A education is <unk> but deal with this problem requires each one of us to take the reins on the issue, and let's be a better model to follow for women and girls in our own lives.
It defy the status of the current status of like women are seen and talked about our circles.
It's not good to tell you the contribution of our politicians in <unk> or the size of their <unk> or <unk> that determination or the success of an Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to start to judge people by what they are, not as you see them.
So all of us can start by taking responsibility for the kind of images and comments that we published in our social networks.
We can tell people based on their effort and their actions and not their appearance.
And let me ask you, when's the last time you get a <unk>
In short, we have to work together as communities, like governments and business to really change our culture, so that our children will grow to valuing their whole person, valuing poverty, diversity, <unk>
We need to put people who actually make a difference in a <unk>
To make a difference in the real world, let's make them the ones that go on the big screen because we just create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they believe that you see the <unk> of being who they are, or to achieve what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in their lives.
Who do you have in mind?
<unk>
<unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk>
It could be simply the woman who is two <unk> what would it mean for her if it was released from that <unk> voice in his interior, which was <unk> by not having long legs -- more <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk>
What would it mean for her if we <unk> this and make the potential for that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with the images is <unk> us all.
But let's bring our children the truth.
It turns out that the way you see is just a part of your identity, and the truth is that we love them for those who are and because of what they do, and how they make us feel.
It brings the self-worth into the <unk> of our schools.
Let's change each one of us, the way we talk about and we compare to other people.
And <unk> together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the little <unk> of a year of today, they become the ability of change in their own tomorrow.
So let's do it.
On November 15, 1990, a gentleman named <unk> <unk> entered a hotel in Manhattan and killed the rabbi <unk> <unk> the leader of the League of Defense <unk> <unk>
<unk> was initially <unk> but being a prisoner for other poor charges in the company of others, started planning on attacks about 12 <unk> in New York, including <unk> <unk> and the U.N. <unk>
Fortunately, those plans was <unk> by an FBI of the FBI.
Sadly, the <unk> of 1993 in the World Trade Center, couldn't be <unk>
Later on, it would be convicted of his participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being an engineer <unk> with a loving mother, high school high school high school teacher to give me a happy childhood for me.
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a way of Islam, that very few, even most Muslims get to meet.
For experience, I saw that when people take time to work, it doesn't need a lot to get to wish the same things in life.
However, in all of religion, in all of religion, in all of a human group, there is always a small fraction of people who are <unk> so <unk> to their convictions that thinks that we need to use all the possible means that everyone lived like them.
A few months before he arrest him, he sat down with me and explained that in the last few week, he and some friends, had been going to talk training in Long Island, to practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We got to the <unk> <unk> which, without knowing that our group, was <unk> by the FBI.
When I was <unk> my father helped me hold the <unk> on the shoulder and explained how to aim for about 30 feet.
That day, with the last bullet that he shot I gave the little orange light on the goal and, for surprise of all, especially me, all the goal broke out on flames.
My uncle went back to the other and in Arabic, said <unk> <unk>
As a parent, such a son.
And all of all, the comment there was a lot of laugh. But only a few years later I understood what they found so funny.
Did you see in me, the same level of destruction that my father could <unk>
Those people would later be committed to put a <unk> <unk> with 700 kilos of explosives on the underground parking lot of the World Trade Center -- causing a explosion that killed six people and injured other 1,000.
I admired those men.
I called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved me 20 times.
Every time I started feeling comfortable near someone was already time to pack and get to another city.
As it was always me the new side of the class often was a victim of <unk>
It was secret <unk> my identity to avoid being the <unk> but it will be the new of the silent and <unk> and <unk> was enough <unk>
So most of the time I spend it at home reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
For these reasons I didn't develop social skills, to say <unk> <unk> I wasn't prepared for the real world.
I <unk> opera to people, based on <unk> indicators like their race or their religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that they put to test my way to think, was during the 2008 presidential elections.
In a <unk> program I was involved in the National <unk> <unk> in Philadelphia.
My group was <unk> in the subject of juvenile violence, as I had been a victim of <unk> almost my entire life, was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from different <unk>
One day, at the end of the <unk> I discovered that one of the boys with whom we had <unk> was Jewish
I took several days out of light this detail and realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend and quite frankly, I was very proud of being able to defeat the barrier that life had made me believe that it was <unk>
Another crucial moment arose when I got a summer work in Bush -- a <unk> park.
I found myself with people of all kinds of beliefs and cultures. That experience it turns out fundamental to the development of my character.
All life had taught me that the <unk> was a sin and by extension, all gay were bad <unk>
I had a chance to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the <unk> and less critics I had seen in life.
Having been <unk> as a child, I developed a sense of empathy toward the suffering of others, but it wasn't easy for me to treat people, exactly the way I wish to be <unk>
So I was able to contrast the stereotypes that they had taught me as a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know what it is about being homosexual but I know what it is to be <unk> for something beyond my control.
Then came the <unk> <unk>
All night Jon Stewart made me be honest with my <unk> and he was helping me see that race of people, religion or sexual orientation, they have nothing to do with character.
In many ways, he became my figure in a moment that I was desperately <unk>
Sometimes the inspiration can come from the unexpected, and that a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life than my own father, <unk> was not in vain.
One day I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my way of thinking, and she told me something to keep in my heart forever, while it's alive.
She looked at me with the tired eyes of someone who had suffered enough <unk> <unk> and he said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that moment I realized how much negative energy you need to keep all of that hate inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why would I go out and put myself at a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done it because I hope that someone, one day, who is about bringing violence to violence, I can hear my story and understand that there is a better way to do, which even though I would tell you about this violent ideology and <unk> I didn't get to make me <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and <unk>
I do it by the victims of terrorism, and for their loved ones, because of the terrible pain and the loss that terrorism has produced in their lives.
For the victims of terrorism, I will talk against those <unk> acts as rejection of the actions of my father.
With this simple stage, I put it here as proof that violence is not an inherent religion or not, that children don't have to follow the trails of their parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you all.  Thank you very much.  Thank you very much.
At this point, there is a film that projects in their minds.
It's a <unk> film, incredible.
It's in 3D and it has <unk> sound of what you hear and see right now, but that's just the beginning.
Your film has <unk> and texture.
It feels your body, your pain, your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, as moments of your childhood that you project in front of your eyes.
And it has always a voice superimposed on your flow of conscious thinking.
The heart of the film is you who experience it all directly.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the experience of mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of the existence of the human.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have a internal film in your own.
There is nothing else to make it more directly.
At least I know that I have a <unk>
I have no sure that you are conscious.
Consciousness is also the reason for living.
If we weren't conscious, nothing in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time is the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these films <unk>
Why are we not only robots that we get to produce results without experiencing the movie <unk>
Right now, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate consciousness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible to be impossible for consciousness.
Science in nature, is objective of us.
<unk> by nature, is <unk>
So there can never be a science of consciousness.
Because for almost all the 20th century, they <unk> that vision.
psychology was studying behavioral behavior, neuroscience is the <unk> brain, but nobody mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED began, there was very few scientific jobs about consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, everything started to change.
<unk> like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> said, <unk> is the time for science to <unk> <unk>
And since then, there was a real bang, a flowering of the scientific work of consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of the science of consciousness in the recent years was the pursuit of <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw some of this kind of wonderful work I presented Nancy <unk> a few minutes ago.
Now we understand much better, for example, areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces or feeling pain or feeling happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a science of explanations for that.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of experiences, but we don't know why.
I would like to explain by saying that this kind of work in neuroscience is answers some questions that we want to explain consciousness. The questions about what some brain areas do and what it is <unk>
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
<unk> <unk>
There's actually no easy problem with consciousness.
I don't address the real mystery of this <unk> Why is all the physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is there an internal movie <unk>
Right now, we can't understand it.
And you can say, let's give it a few years to the neuroscience.
It's going to become another emerging phenomenon like <unk> like <unk> like life, and we're going to find <unk>
The typical <unk> are all cases of emerging behaviors, how do you operate the <unk> how do you use the <unk> how they <unk> are adapting and <unk> the living organisms are questions.
So that could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and brain functions like a <unk> phenomenon, how do we talk about, how do we talk about, how do we talk about, how do we talk about it, all of them are questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, questions about behavior are among the easy problems.
But the hard problem is the question of why it is that everything is accompanied by a <unk> experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, actually doesn't still have a lot to say.
I'm a <unk> <unk>
I want a scientific theory of <unk> that works. For a long time, I would hit my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure terms that would work.
But at the end, I came to the conclusion that that didn't work for <unk> reasons.
I think we have to focus on this point.
We have a very wonderful <unk> chain, so we get used to this, physics explains chemistry, chemistry explains biology, biology explains the psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit into this <unk>
On the one hand, it's a fact that we are conscious.
For another, we don't know how to accommodate that idea to our scientific worldview.
I believe that consciousness, right now is sort of a <unk> something that we need to integrate our vision in the world, but we don't know still how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that at first, crazy before we can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.
Their crazy idea is that there is no such a hard problem of consciousness.
All the idea of the internal subjective film includes a kind of illusion or confusion.
Actually, what you have to do, is to explain the functions of the brain behaviors -- and this is how everything needs <unk>
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of <unk> purely based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and for many others, that vision is pretty close to simply deny that the observation of consciousness is satisfying to me.
But I am in a different direction.
And in the time I get there, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
The physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe as fundamental <unk> space, the space and the mass.
<unk> laws of fundamental laws like the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and properties and properties don't tell us in terms of nothing else.
On the contrary, you think it is considered principles, and it's built the world.
Sometimes, the list of the fundamental is <unk>
In the 19th century, he found that you can't explain the electromagnetic phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts <unk> space, and <unk> law, and so he applied the basic laws of the <unk> and he applied the electric charge as a fundamental concept that those laws <unk>
I think that's the situation that we found with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas <unk> space, time, <unk> to the question of logic -- we have to <unk> the list.
The most natural thing would be to <unk> the self as a fundamental thing, a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that suddenly it's not the object of science.
It opens the way for <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect consciousness with other fundamental concepts -- space, time, the mass, the physical processes.
<unk> sometimes say that we want fundamental laws so simple that we can put it into a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws so simple that we could put it in a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we need.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Every system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> for all, <unk> for mind, every system is conscious, not only humans, dogs mice, flies, even the microbes of Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be full of distress when you think <unk> always traveling at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, so no.
But the thought of thinking is that maybe photons can have some element of crude feeling of consciousness.
This may sound a little crazy for you.
How do you think about something so <unk>
Part of this comes from the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing.
If it's <unk> like space, the time and mass, is natural assume that it can also be universal, like the others.
It's also worth noticing that although the idea seems to us, it's much less for people of different cultures, where the human mind seems more a continuum with nature.
One more profound reason comes from the idea that perhaps the simplest and powerful way to find fundamental laws that we think of thinking with the physical process, is <unk> consciousness with information.
Whenever there is processing processing, there's <unk>
<unk> of complex <unk> like a human being, as a human <unk>
<unk> of simple information, <unk>
A very exciting thing is that in the recent years a neuroscientist, <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory and developed the <unk> with mathematicians.
It has a mathematical measure of information integration, which calls <unk> which measures the degree of information integrated into a system.
And I am supposed to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of integration, a high degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there is a degree of information integration, and just quite significant, degree of consciousness as important.
But when you get to the worms. microbes, particles, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of information integration, but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there will still be a different level of <unk>
It actually gives a fundamental law of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Moreover, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate consciousness into physical world.
<unk> and philosophers have often observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of the reality using a lot of equations, but we don't talk about the reality that underlies it.
As it explains Stephen Hawking, where is the fire of <unk>
From the <unk> vision, the equations of physics can be able to leave as they are, but you can use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
According to this vision, the consciousness is the one that puts it at equations.
In that vision, consciousness is not to be outside of the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right in the center.
This vision, I think, <unk> vision has the potential to <unk> our relationship with nature, and it can have social and ethical consequences fairly serious.
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that I didn't have to eat nothing that had consciousness, so I must be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you accept that vision, you're pretty hungry.
I think you think about it, this tends to transform your <unk> while what it matters in terms and the moral <unk> is not so much the fact about consciousness, but its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system in Samantha movie <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the vision of the information, she has a complicated data processing processing, so the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right now, they are being done with serious ethical problems about the ethics of intelligent computers and the ethics ethic.
Finally, you can ask for the <unk> of <unk> the planet.
Canada has its own <unk>
Or at a local level, an integrated group, like the audience at a TED Talk, at this point, we have a collective consciousness -- a film internal film for this entire TED group of every single <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least a question that you have to take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical vision, and I don't know if it's correct.
I'm actually more sure about the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing, that in the second one, that it's universal.
So vision raises a lot of questions, a lot of challenges, like, how do those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness that we know and love.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we go on the right way toward a theory of serious awareness.
If not, well, probably this is the hardest problem in science and philosophy.
We can't wait for the night to the morning.
But I think we will finally figure it out.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we only need the crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a little rural village in Victoria.
I had a very normal profile in education.
I went to school, I took my friends, <unk> me with my younger sisters.
It was very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came up to my parents because I wanted to <unk> for a community <unk>
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice -- but there's a wrong problem.
She actually hasn't done anything."  And they were right.
I went to school, I had good grades. After school, I had a <unk> profile in my mother, and spent a lot of time looking at the <unk> series, the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yes, I know. What contradiction.
But they were right.
I didn't do anything that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing that might be considered as a achievement if we take disability out of the equation.
years later, he was in the second part of teaching him in a high school school, so only after about 20 minutes in the class of studies -- a guy raised his hand and said, "Hey, when will you give you your <unk>
I said, "What <unk>
Well, I had been talking about the law of <unk> for a good 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your <unk> speech.
When people in the wheelchair, they talk about <unk> things at school?"
<unk> in the <unk> hall.
And it was when I realized, this child had had disability with disabled people as inspiration.
And we don't are. And it's not the guilt of the boy, I mean, that's true for many of us.
For us, people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We are not real people. We're there to inspire us.
And in fact, I'm on this stage <unk> what I do in this wheelchair wheelchair and probably you are waiting for you. Right?  Yes.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid <unk> <unk>
I'm not here for <unk>
I'm here to tell you that they've lied to us in relation to disability.
Yes, they've sold us the lie that disability is a <unk> A capital <unk>
It's something bad and living with a disability makes it remarkable.
It's not bad and you can't make you <unk>
And over the last few years, we've been able to spread even more this lie across social media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk>
Or is this <unk> <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there's a lot of them.
You may have seen one of the girl with no hands drawing with a pencil by the mouth.
You may have seen a child running with carbon fiber <unk>
And there's a lot of these pictures, which are what we call <unk> <unk>
And use the term porn term <unk> because we <unk> a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, <unk> the individuals in the benefit of people without disabilities.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so we can see them and think, "Well, for very bad that my life, could be worse.
I could be that guy.
But if you're that person?
I've lost the account of the number of times that I've been talking about strange <unk> to tell you that I believe I am brave or a source of inspiration, and this is going to happen before my work had a public profile.
It was like me to get up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, those images are <unk> to people with disability to benefit from people without disabilities.
They're there for you to see you and think that things are not so bad for you, or to put your concerns in perspective.
And life as a human person is actually a hard thing.
Let's get some things.
But the things we care about are not the things that you can think of.
They're not relative to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately because I <unk> the social model of <unk> which tells us that we are more disabled, because of the society that we live than because of our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very <unk> with him.
I need the things that I need to do, and I've learned to take the best of your capacity as you do, and that's what happens with the kids of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything out of common.
They're simply using their bodies getting the best of their ability.
So it's really just <unk> in the way we do that, by sharing those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it says it as a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because of the lie, because they have been sold this lie that disability makes us quite remarkable.
And honestly, he doesn't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here <unk> the inspiration, and you think, "My God, <unk> are not sometimes inspired by anything?"
And I actually know I am in it.
<unk> from other people with disability at all times.
However, I don't know that I'm more lucky than them.
<unk> that this is a great idea to use a <unk> <unk> to pick up the things that they fall over.  <unk> the <unk> trick of how to upload your mobile phone battery on your chair.
Great.
We learn about the force and resistance of others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that we <unk> and we <unk>
I really believe that that lie that have been sold about disability is the greatest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that quote: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that it is lie because it's not true, because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles before a little bit of ladders has not ever made it into a <unk>
Never.    Just to a television screen is not going to go to the <unk> for people who are <unk>
Not a lot of people in the middle of a <unk> and <unk> a positive attitude to turn all those books into the <unk>
It's just not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15 year-old girl sitting in his bedroom watching <unk> the <unk> <unk> who is not considered to be considered nothing to be in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have so low expectations of the people with disability that we will be <unk> because of the wake of the bed and remember our names for tomorrow.
I want to live in a world where the genuine achievement of individuals with disabilities, and I want to live in a world where a boy at the 11 grade school is not a bit surprised that his new teacher is a <unk>
disability is not making us <unk> but question what you believe to know about what you do.
Thank you.
What do you have to see <unk> reality and <unk> with the <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> <unk>
Unfortunately, today I'll just answer one of those questions, so please don't get <unk>
When people think about <unk> they think about <unk> <unk> and Tom <unk> <unk> the hands in the air, but reality reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that will happen in our days and is going to happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know it, because augmented reality change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how did we get to reality <unk>
The first step, is what I take <unk> on Google <unk>
I'm sure many of you are familiar with them.
What you may not know is that Google <unk> are a device that lets you see what I see.
I'll allow you to experience what is a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try to <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you can relate to your imagination.
We can use the Google Glass, underneath a helmet and know what is running through the game of play as 100 percent, the blood hitting the ears.
We can know that it feels like a <unk> Man <unk> <unk> trying to <unk> it all its way.
I've been there and I assure you, it's not nice.
So let's take some videos to show you what this is using the Google <unk> under the helmet, and give you an idea of that.
Unfortunately, it's not images of the practices of <unk> because the idea of the emerging technology is a submarine up to the surface. But we do what we can.
So let's look at a video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible to be <unk>
A little bit <unk> a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what it is to be <unk> in the football field, from the perspective of the <unk>
You may have noticed that you lack people, the rest of the equipment.
We have a video of them, <unk> from the University of Washington.
<unk> <unk> Mice <unk> Mice <unk>
Blue <unk> Blue <unk> Go! Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more like feeling in the field, but it has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
<unk> want that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field, being their favorite players, and I have asked me on YouTube and in <unk> you can see from the angle of a <unk>
Or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we get out of <unk> how we take it to the next <unk>
We took it to that level using something called <unk> <unk> which probably many of you know.
<unk> <unk> has been described as the most realistic virtual reality apparatus ever created, and it's not <unk> cheap.
And I'm going to show you why by asking you for this video.
Man: Oh, okay.
No, no, no! I don't want to follow <unk> No!
Oh my God. Ah!
<unk> That is the experience of a man in a <unk> roller coaster for his life.
What is the experience of a fan when you <unk> a video of Adrian <unk> crossing the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before I run and make a <unk> which will be the experience of a fan of <unk>
When I can be <unk> running through the <unk> launching the ball at the bottom of the network?  Or <unk> doing a <unk> in <unk>
What is their experience when you go from a mountain to more than 100 miles like a <unk> <unk>
Maybe the baby <unk> <unk>
But this is not even <unk>
It's just virtual reality, <unk>
How do we get the reality <unk> <unk>
<unk> reality reality when <unk> <unk> and owners look at the information of what people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use technology to win.
They like to win. They give them money.
So, here's a quick refresher on technology in <unk>
In 1965, the <unk> of Baltimore had a <unk> to his <unk> <unk> to play it faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to <unk>
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the <unk> put <unk> in the <unk> of the <unk> and then in the <unk>
They had more viewers because it was faster, more entertaining.
In <unk> imagine that they are a player coming back to your group, and you see your next play in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that you carry on -- you don't have to worry about forget a <unk>
<unk> the strategy.
Just go out to the field and <unk>
And the coaches want it because if they don't follow their instructions, they lose it, and they hate losing <unk>
If you lose parties <unk>
And they don't want that.
But augmented reality is not just a <unk> <unk>
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your way to play the game.
How would you do that?
Well, a very simple option would be to have a camera on every corner of the stadium having a view from the top of the people that are down.
You also get information from the <unk> sensors and <unk> something that is already working.
And all that information gets to your <unk>
The good teams will know <unk>
The bad ones will have information <unk>
This is <unk> the good teams of the bad guys.
So your computer team will be as important as your <unk> and the analysis of data will stop being <unk>
It would be also for <unk> Who would have <unk>
How would it be in the country?
So imagine that it's the field.
And they took the ball and <unk>
<unk> on an open receptor -- suddenly a <unk> on the left of your bombsight -- you would tell you that a defense behind you is going to be <unk> not <unk> but the <unk> system.
It <unk> the protection.
Another <unk> <unk> there's an open receptor for you.
<unk> <unk> but <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where to land. However, the receptor sees in their bombsight -- an area of grass that lights and can change the race.
He <unk> it takes the <unk> runs and runs <unk>
The audience is <unk> and the fans have followed the move from every angle.
This is something that creates massive emotion in the game.
I'm going to do a lot of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field.
They want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of sport because it's too profitable for not to be.
But what I ask you is, we want this only use of reality.
Let's use it just as bread and <unk> like our entertainment entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to foster the empathy between human beings, to show someone what it is, literally, being in the other person's place.
We know what this technology is worth for <unk>
It generates billions of revenue a year.
But how much is this technology for a professor in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how good is their actions from the perspective of <unk>
How much is this technology for a gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show us the world how it lives <unk>
How much is it worth for a <unk> <unk> or Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think more about space and science instead of <unk> notes and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality is close.
The questions we do, the decisions we take and the challenges that we face, as well as the <unk>
Thank you.
I recently moved to me after 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years ago I got the <unk> the southern end of Lofa County, which includes the Golden Gate <unk>
The bridge is a <unk> structure, known for its beautiful view of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean and its <unk> <unk>
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The Golden Gate Bridge was opened up in <unk>
Joseph <unk> a chief of the <unk> of building the bridge, said that, "The bridge is actually <unk>
<unk> from the bridge is not practical and <unk>
But from its openness, over 1,600 people have jumped on their death from that bridge.
Some people believe that travel between the two towers will take them to another dimension, this bridge has been <unk> as such, so that every one from him would tell you from all your concerns and pain, and the waters that go under <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After one of four to five seconds, the body hits the water about 120 miles per hour.
The impact is breaking off the bones, some of which <unk> vital organs.
Most of the rise of impact.
The ones that don't normally get away in the water <unk> and then they <unk>
I don't think that those who are <unk> this method of suicide will realize that they are going to be <unk>
This is the wire.
Except about the two towers, there are 32 inches of parallel <unk> the bridge.
This is where most people have to be before you get to get to life.
I can tell you for experience that once the person is on that edge, and at the darkest moment, it's very hard to bring it back.
I took this photo last year while this young man spoke with an official looking at his life.
I want to tell you a joy that we had this day to bring it back into the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we had no formal training.
<unk> to channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service to those who <unk> the suicide, but the officers as well.
We've come a long way since then.
Today, children's veterans and psychologists train the new official people.
This is Jason <unk>
I met him at July 22 last year when you get a call from a suicide bomber sitting in the <unk>
<unk> and when I got there, he watched Jason talking with an official by the Golden Gate officer.
Jason was only 32 years old, and he had flown until here from New Jersey.
In fact, he had flown down to two times before from New Jersey to try and suicide from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> we asked us if we knew about the history of the <unk> box.
<unk> the mythology of the mythology -- <unk> <unk> created <unk> and sent it to the Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity could more than <unk> and she opened the box.
She came out of <unk> <unk> and all kinds of <unk> against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
And so Jason asked us, "What happens if you open the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped <unk> leaned on the right, and it left.
This kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind and intelligent guy in New Jersey had just taken away life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the rabbi of the family called me to see how it was.
The parents of Jason had had order.
<unk> damage from suicide damage to a lot of people.
I give you these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or someone loved it was <unk>
What do you <unk>
Tell me what to say?
In my experience, it's not just to talk about, but you have to listen.
Listening to understand.
Don't <unk> <unk> or say to the person you know how it feels like it feels because they probably don't know it.
Just stand there, you can be the tipping point that you need.
If you think that someone is <unk> you're not afraid of <unk> and asking the question.
One way to ask you the question is: <unk> in similar circumstances have thought about finishing your life, you've had these <unk>
They get to the person in front of it can save the life and be the inflection point for them.
Other signs of <unk> despair, believe that things are terrible and they're never going to be <unk> to believe that there is nothing you can do to the <unk> social isolation, and a lost interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read you your letter.
She lost his son on the January of January of this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days, and it's with his <unk> and blessing that I read it.
"Hello, <unk> I imagine you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience being there.
I'm thinking that I should go on the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to your friends who tell your friends, and so on.
I'm still quite <unk> but I see even more moments of realizing that Mike won't go home.
Mike was driving from <unk> to San Francisco to see <unk> game.
It never came there.
He called the police of <unk> and <unk> it like disappeared that night.
The next morning, two officials came to my home and reported that the <unk> car was down on the bridge.
A witness had seen it jump from the bridge to the <unk> of the late day before.
Thank you very much for fighting those who can be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who has not been wrong with not any real mental mental disease.
It shouldn't be so easy to end with it.
My sentences are with you for your struggle.
The <unk> the Golden Gate Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful harbor -- not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and tour the way his son took that day, and also the courage to go ahead.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I mean with hope and value.
On March 11, of 2005, I replied a radio call by a <unk> subject on the sidewalk sidewalk <unk>
<unk> my <unk> on the sidewalk and watched this man, Kevin <unk> standing on the sidewalk.
When I saw it, it immediately <unk> the <unk> and stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
During the next hour and the next half I heard like Kevin talked about his depression and despair.
Kevin decided for his account that day going back on that lane and give it to the life another opportunity.
When Kevin came back, he turned it out.
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked him, "What was it that he made it <unk> and gave him the hope and life else <unk>
And you know what he told me?
He said, "Are you <unk>
You stopped talking and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from a mother of <unk> and I have that letter with me, and I would like to <unk>
"Dear Mr. <unk> Nothing to erase the <unk> events and you are one of the reasons that Kevin followed with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness for which it has been properly <unk>
He took Kevin to Kevin when I was only six months, completely unaware of all those traits -- <unk> but thank God, we now know.
Kevin is in order, like he said.
We give God for you.
I was in debt with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end, she writes <unk> When I visited the General General in San Francisco that night, you <unk> like the patient.
<unk> I knew I had to <unk>
Today, Kevin is a <unk> father and an active member of society.
He talks openly about the events of that day and their depression with the hope that his story inspire others.
suicide is not only something I have found myself at work.
It's personal.
My grandfather was <unk> with poison.
That act, despite finishing his own pain, the chance of knowing him.
This is what suicide.
For most people who are <unk> or those who consider the suicide, they wouldn't think they hurt another person.
They just want your own <unk> pain.
Usually this is achieved only three things: sleep, or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illness and suicide calls around the bridge.
Of those incidents that I've been directly involved -- I've only lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who spoke about an hour.
During that time, I took my hand at three times.
In the end, I looked at me, and he said, <unk> sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
<unk> absolutely horrible.
I want to tell you, though, that most of the people that we get to contact with that bridge is not <unk>
In addition, those few who have jumped on the bridge and lived and that can talk about it, that one percent or two, most of those people have said that the second one who leaves the railing realized that they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge isn't only connected to <unk> with San Francisco, but also the people.
That connection, or bridge that we do, is something that all and every one of us should be working to do.
suicide can prevent.
There's help. There's hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you don't are, but in your inside you know what you are, and you ask you, how do you tell you about that?
I have to be something unique in that sense, but I'm not alone in any way I'm alone.
When I became a model I felt I had achieved the dream that I had ever had since a child.
My outside was finally <unk> with my inner inner self.
For reasons reasons, that I'm going to be going over later, when I look at this photo -- I'm thinking, you know, you get it out of the <unk> <unk>
But last October, I discovered that I'm just starting.
We all <unk> our families, our religion, our society, our moment in history, even our bodies.
Some of them have the value of <unk> to get rid of the limitations of the skin of the skin or because of the beliefs of the people around us.
They're people who are always challenging the status quo, which is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years old, a lot of my neighbors, a lot of my friends, my failed agent, ignored my story.
I think this mystery is called revelation.
This is mine.
I signed up as <unk> as being born because of my <unk> appearance.
I remember my five years in the Philippines, in my house, I was always wearing this shirt on the head.
And my mom was going, "Why do you always take that t-shirt on the <unk>
I said, "Mom, it's my hair. I'm a <unk>
I knew so how do we <unk>
<unk> has always been considered a <unk> but now we know that, really, is a more complex and mystery thing.
Because of my success, I never told me to share my story, not because I thought it would be a bad thing, but why the world is about those of us who want to be <unk>
Every day I appreciate being a woman.
I have mama, Dad and a family who would accept me as I am.
Many are not so fortunate.
There's a long tradition in <unk> culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a <unk> <unk> <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines that celebrated these puzzles.
I was standing in front of the stage and I remember that this beautiful woman came to me, and I remember that moment as if something happened to me, this is the kind of woman I want to be.
And when I was 15 years old, when I was still wearing a man, I met this woman called <unk>
It's the director of a contest of beauty <unk>
That night she asked me, "Why haven't ever been involved in the <unk> competition.
He told me that if she went to her, she was going to be over the <unk> and <unk> and that night, I won in the bathroom <unk> won in <unk> and she was a third finalist in the top of 40 <unk>
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of <unk>
Not a lot of people can say that their first job was <unk> of <unk> women, but I can.
I also met the goddess of <unk> especially when I went to remote <unk>
But more important than all that, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001 my mom.
I was <unk>
I told my mom, "Mommy, am I <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a <unk>
But then, two weeks later, I called me and said, "You know if you get to the United States and you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear about.
My mom suggested I would put two <unk> to my name.
She also accompanied me when I was involved in Thailand at 19 years.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities do do the most sophisticated surgery -- sophisticated and secure.
At that time in the U.S., it was necessary for surgery before they changed the name and gender.
So in 2001 I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driving license with the name <unk> and the <unk> <unk>
It was a great moment.
For some people, their identity paper means power or power to get a <unk> but for me it was the license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly, my fears saw <unk>
I felt I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and to be model.
Many are not so fortunate.
I think of this woman of <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who was living in his truth, but he was <unk> he put his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All the 20 of November we make a global <unk> by <unk> Day.
I am on this scenario because of a long story of people that are <unk> and stood up to injustice.
This is Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't keep living my truth alone and just for me.
I want to do the best to help others live their truth without shame, and fear.
I'm here, <unk> for some day there is no more <unk> than 20 <unk>
My deepest truth led me to accept what I am.
Will you do it?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.  <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Sure. All right, thank you first, to thank all of my <unk>
I think of my support for my parents especially, my family, which is very strong.
I remember all the times I've been to young women who have been <unk> and sometimes when they called me and told me that his parents couldn't accept it, I would take my mom and say, "Mom, you can call this <unk>
Sometimes it worked -- it's not just identity identity, that's what is at the center of what we are, right?
I mean, we all assigned a gender to be born, and what I try to do is put on the table -- the topic that sometimes that <unk> <unk> and that there should be a space that allowed people to <unk> and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The <unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should have understanding.
There should be space for curiosity and to ask questions, and I hope that all of you are my allies.
KS: Thank you. Very rare <unk> Thank you.
In a lot of <unk> and tribal societies, the parents are usually known for their kids, but I'm one of the few parents who knows for their daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign for education defending his rights in 2007. And when his efforts were <unk> in 2011, the National <unk> <unk> became very <unk> a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if I took a look at the history of mankind, the story of women is the history of the <unk> of inequality, of violence and exploitation.
You see, in the <unk> societies, right from the very beginning, when when they were born, their birth is not <unk>
He's not welcome for his father, not by his mother.
On the neighborhood side, he gives his <unk> to the mother and no one <unk> the father.
And a mother was <unk> so much for having a little girl.
When he gives birth to the first child, the first daughter, the first daughter, the first daughter, the first daughter, <unk>
When he gives birth to the second daughter, <unk> and, with the hope of a son, when he <unk> his third daughter, feels guilty like a criminal.
Not just the suffering, but the daughter was just the <unk> daughter when it grows, he suffers as well.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, it is left home and school to their siblings.
Up until the age of 12 years old, it has a good life.
You can <unk>
You can play with his friends on the street, and it can move on the streets like a butterfly.
But when it comes into adolescence, when I turned 13 years old, you signed up from his house without a male <unk>
It's confined to four walls of their house.
It's not a free person.
It becomes the honor called his father and his brothers and his family, and if you get the code of that <unk> of course, it could even kill it.
And it's interesting that this piece of honor code is not only affecting the lives of a <unk> it also affects the lives of male members of the family.
So this brother, <unk> the joys of his life and happiness of his sisters in the name of the honor of the honor.
And there's a norm more of the <unk> societies called <unk>
It's supposed to be very <unk> very humble and very <unk>
It's the best judgment.
The model of a good girl must be <unk>
It is supposed to be silent and embracing the decisions of their father and their mother and people's choices even if they don't like.
If you put it with a man who doesn't like or if the <unk> with an old man has to <unk> because he doesn't want to be <unk> <unk>
If the <unk> very young, you have to take it.
Otherwise, the <unk> <unk>
And what happens in the end?
In the words of a <unk> "The <unk> the <unk> and then gives birth to more children and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson of <unk> his daughter and the same honor of honor to his children.
And this vicious cycle continues and continues.
<unk> brothers and sisters, when I was born <unk> and for the first time, believe me, I don't like newborns, to be honest, but when I was there, and I looked at his eyes, believe me, I was incredibly <unk>
And so much before I came back, I thought about his name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> of <unk> and he called my daughter and so on.
But when I was lost, they all were men, and I grabbed my pen, and I <unk> a line of my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she grew, when she was four and a half and a half and a half years old, I was going to get it in my school.
You might ask, why should I mention a little girl in a <unk>
Yes, I must <unk>
You can take it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in <unk> societies, in tribal societies, is a great event for life life.
<unk> in a school means the recognition of his identity and his name.
One of the way to school means that it's entered the world of dreams and the aspirations where it can explore their potential for their future life.
I have five sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks before, when they <unk> the form of a <unk> Canadian and was in the relative part of the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason I had never seen the names of my sisters.
That was the reason I value my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters nor to his daughters, I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
The <unk> to sit with me when my friends came to see me.
The encouraged to go with me to different meetings.
And all these values, I've tried to <unk> in their personality.
And this wasn't just for her, just to <unk>
I've got all these good values in my school to girls and boys alike.
I used education for <unk>
My daughters, taught the students to forget the lesson of <unk>
I taught students to forget the lesson of the so-called <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, <unk> for more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights, and in particular, for women's rights.
It was called <unk>
That means a complete denial of people's participation.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
girls were banned to go to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to markets.
The musicians were <unk> the <unk> girls and the singers at the <unk>
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was terrifying to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you talk about their rights.
It's really terrifying.
At 10 years, <unk> got up and raised on the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper for the BBC, of the BBC, offered to her herself for the documentaries of New York Times and talked about every platform that she could find.
And his voice was the most powerful.
It was <unk> like a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason that the Taliban couldn't tolerate his campaign and October October of 2012, he was shot by <unk> on the head.
It was one day <unk> for my family and me.
The world became a great black hole.
Whereas my daughter was <unk> between life and death, I was going to hear my wife and "I must <unk> for what happened to my daughter, <unk>
And he said to me, "Please do not <unk>
<unk> the fair thing.
<unk> your life in play because of the cause of peace, and by the cause of education, and your daughter was inspired by you and <unk>
They were both on the right path and God <unk>
And these few words would have a lot of words for me, and I didn't go back again.
When I was <unk> I was in the hospital and he had severe headaches and strong headaches from your head because his facial nerve, was cut down, I used to see a dark shadow that was <unk> by the face of my wife.
But my daughter never <unk>
I used to be <unk> "I'm okay with my smile, <unk> and <unk> in my face.
I'm going to be good at, please don't <unk>
It was a comfort for us, and it was <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, we've learned from her to resist the hardest moments and I'm happy to share with you that despite being an icon for women's rights and women, it's like any <unk> girl in years.
<unk> when you didn't have his task.
They were fighting with his brothers, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What is especially about my <unk> which has made so bold to <unk> so brave and <unk>
I mean, don't ask me what I did.
<unk> what I didn't do.
I didn't cut their wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> of the brain now, 18 years ago, and since that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I'm an engineering engineering.
And I want to tell you that I recently joined the Google <unk> where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> the <unk> of Google <unk> but all the work that I'm going to talk about today about the science of the brain, I did it before I joined Google or outside of my work there.
Having said this, there's a stigma thing, when you get to a brain response.
You're still being <unk> or not?
If you're not like that, you will be able to be <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't gray, but it was the dead part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide how much to take, from more than a dozen powerful chemicals every day, because if I didn't take anything, it would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about combinations and <unk> and trying to <unk> them to go alive.
More than I've been saved by a little bit.
But luckily, I have a soul of <unk> so I decided that I would take to try and get the <unk> <unk> because there is no clear map that says it in <unk>
I started trying to try and try and get shocked by looking at how little changes in the <unk> doses of dramatically my <unk> my sense of who I am, my sense of thinking, my behavior with others.
A particularly <unk> case, for a few months, I tried a dose and chemical chemicals for a <unk> man, and I was surprised by looking at how to <unk> my thoughts.
I was always <unk> I thought all the time in sex, and I thought it was the most intelligent person around the world, and --  -- of course, many times in the past I've met several kinds of words, or maybe some versions of it.
It turned out as an end.
But my great surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> a little bit <unk> to fix a problem that had the front, and it just didn't happen like this.
So I couldn't manage that.
It changed my <unk>
But I think that experience gave me a new appreciation for men and about what they have to <unk> since then I get better with men.
What I was trying to do with the <unk> those hormones and neurotransmitters and so forth, it was regain my intelligence after the disease and the <unk> my creative thinking, my <unk>
<unk> thinking almost always in pictures, and that became my point of key reference, how do you get those mental images that I used to use to create <unk> my ideas, if we were <unk> new ideas and <unk> situations.
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes and <unk> look at things like this.
They thought the images and the mental ideas were the same thing.
Today there are people who challenge this idea, and there are a lot of discussions about how the mind works, for me, it's simple: for most of us, the mental images are fundamental for <unk> thinking.
So after several years, I got to find the point right now, and I have lots of great mental <unk> really sophisticated and very sophisticated <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to take these mental images very quickly from my mind to the computer screen.
Can you imagine what if a film director would be able to use their imagination just to drive the world that has the way the way?
Or if a musician could get the music out of his head?
There are amazing possibilities with this, like the way that creative people can get to share the speed of light.
And the one is that, the only difficulty to make this is simply increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
Let me show you why I think we are pretty close to get this with two recent experiments that were done by two groups leading into neuroscience.
Both of them both used MRI technology, MRI imaging to represent the brain. You can see the brain scan done by <unk> <unk> and their <unk>
The column on the left shows the scanning of the brain of a person looking at a image.
The middle of the middle shows the scanning of the brain of that individual as it is <unk> looking at that same image.
The column on the right was created by <unk> the central column on the left -- you see that the difference is almost <unk>
This is <unk> in many different individuals with a lot of different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between seeing an image and imagining that same picture is almost <unk>
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is the lab of Jack <unk> in Berkeley, California.
They managed to convert brain waves into visual fields.
Let's put it this way.
In this experiment, I showed the people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while their brains are <unk> to create a great pool of reactions from the brain with video sequences.
Then, I showed you a film with new images -- new animals, new animals, and while they get a new <unk>
And the computer -- using only brain information on the scanning of the scanning of it, to show what it seemed like the person was looking at.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video that you showed you.
This blew us <unk>
We're pretty close to this.
We just need to improve the resolution.
And now, remember, when you see a picture and when you can imagine that same image, you believe in the brain the same <unk>
This took place with the brain scanning systems of higher resolution, available today, and its resolution is increased as a thousand times in the last years.
Now we need to increase the resolution of a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do you think about it?
There are lots of techniques to do it.
One is to open the skull and introduce electrodes.
I don't offer that one.
A lot of them are proposing new techniques of projection by images, including me, <unk> with the latest MRI result of MRI -- first we need to ask the next, this technology will be the end of the road?
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get more resolution is with bigger magnets is with bigger magnets -- but at this point, more <unk> they only offer small improvements in resolution, not increases by thousands like we need.
I propose this idea: rather than magnets larger, let's make better magnets.
We can create a lot more complex structures with slightly different arrangements like doing a <unk>
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a lot of effort on MRI were to make really big magnets -- right?
However, most recent advances in <unk> of ingenious solutions, <unk> <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> and <unk> radio <unk> in MRI systems.
At the time, instead of a magnetic field where you have <unk> magnetic patterns, structured magnetic frequencies <unk>
So by combining the magnetic patterns with the patterns of the radio processing processing patterns can actually increase the information that can get in a single <unk>
In addition, we can then split our growing knowledge about the structure of the brain and the memory to create the increase in the thousands we need.
By using <unk> we should be able to measure not only the blood fluid -- but the same one of the hormones and the <unk> that I've mentioned and maybe even neural activity. This is sleep.
Will we be able to put our ideas on a direct way to digital media.
Can you imagine if we could go over the language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do we learn how to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are great questions.
It would be <unk> used as a tool to amplify our skills of thinking and communication.
Certainly, this same tool could lead the cure of Alzheimer's and similar diseases.
We have a few options to open up this door.
But anyway, choose a year to happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine that it will take much more.
We need to learn how to give this step together.
Thank you.
I'll talk to you tonight about getting out of the closet, and not just a traditional sense, not just the gay <unk>
I think we all have <unk>
Her <unk> may be to tell some person for the first time that he loves or telling someone who is pregnant, or tell someone who has cancer, or any other difficult conversation that you can get through in life.
This whole thing is a difficult conversation, and even though our issues can vary <unk> the experience of having lived and have come out of that closet to be universal.
It's <unk> and we don't like it, and it must happen.
A lot of years ago, I was working in the South Side of <unk> <unk> a restaurant in the city, and being there, I had to go through several phases of the intensity of the <unk> <unk> not <unk> my armpits, quote the letters of <unk> gave <unk> like a <unk>
And I'll be slope from the <unk> of my <unk> in the short <unk> and I was <unk> my head back, I would usually ask a kid to say, "Hey, you're a kid or <unk>
And he would find it awkward at the table.
<unk> my jaw a little bit more, I would take my coffee with a <unk>
The father <unk> <unk> the newspaper and the mother tossed a cold look at his son.
But I wouldn't tell anything, and <unk> inside.
And I got to the point that every time I went to a place where there was a kid between three and 10 years, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised myself that next time I would have something.
It would have that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
A family silence, but this time was prepared and I was about to go full of the female issues at the table.  I had the quotes of Betty <unk>
<unk> <unk>
Even a piece of the "Vagina Monologues," I <unk>
And so I took a deep breath, and I went down my backs and my backs a <unk> girl with a pink dress, looking at what is not a challenge for a <unk> <unk> just a girl with a question: "You're a guy or <unk>
So I took a deep breath, again, I got <unk> around her, and I said, "Hey, do I know that this is <unk>
I have the short hair like the one of a boy, and you see a girl, but I'm a girl, and you know, as you like to use a pink dress and sometimes you like to use a comfortable pajamas.
Well, I'm more than a girl of a <unk> pajamas.
And that girl looked at me <unk> and he said, "My favorite <unk> is <unk> and has a fish.
You can give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was the whole thing -- it's just <unk>
What about the <unk> that <unk>
It was the easy conversation that I ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl in the <unk> and I, both of us were <unk> the one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some <unk> in my life, and I know, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside the dark, you can't know what color is the walls.
You just know how it feels like a closet.
That's how my expansion is not different than you or yours or yours.
<unk> I'll give you 100 reasons why to get out of my closet was harder than getting out of his, but this is the <unk> The hard thing is not <unk>
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me to explain to someone who have declared in bank <unk> it's harder than saying it has been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that I tell you is more difficult than telling your five year-old son that you're going to be <unk>
There's no more difficult thing -- there's only the hard.
We need to stop classify what is hard to think about what it is difficult for another person to make us feel better or worse in relation to our <unk> and we need to just feel empathy because we all live something difficult.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and they can make them feel security, or at least security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that it doesn't matter what your walls are made -- a <unk> is not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine himself 20 years ago.
I, I had a horse, a horse, a <unk> and <unk> shoes.
It wasn't the militant lesbian ready to fight any four years that would come to the coffee.
It was frozen in the fear, <unk> in a corner of my <unk> dark <unk> and it is moving only a muscle is the scariest thing ever ever done.
My family, my full-time friends, strangers that I've spent my entire life trying to do not <unk> and now the world was going back to purpose.
It was burning the pages of a script that we all have followed by so long, but if you don't toss that <unk> to kill you.
One of my most memorable <unk> was in my sister.
It was the first time that many of us guests knew that I was gay, and when I was doing my <unk> <unk> in my black dress and <unk> walked around the tables and finally came to one where the friends of my parents, people I knew I was known for years.
And after speaking a moment, one of the women <unk> <unk> <unk>
And the battle of the gay story had begun.
<unk> once you were in the <unk>
"Well, yes, the truth is that we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never gone there, but we've heard that it's <unk>
<unk> you know my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and never talked about having <unk>
So what is your favorite TV show.
Our singing program Will and Grace <unk>
And you know who <unk> us.
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but in expecting to show desperately your support, to get me to know that I was on my side, he finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband is wearing <unk>
And I had an opportunity at that moment, as they have all the <unk> <unk>
<unk> might have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very hard to find them and realize that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask to someone, but <unk>
If you're going to be authentic with someone, you have to be prepared for how authentic it is.
This is how hard conversations keep my strong point.
Ask anyone that I had <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I keep doing what I like to call the three principles of <unk>
Now, please look this through the gay perspective, but understand that what it means to get out of any <unk> is essentially the same thing.
Number one: Be authentic.
<unk> <unk> Be yourself.
That girl in the coffee had no <unk> but I was ready for the struggle.
If you want someone to be <unk> the others must do we also suffer.
Number two: Be <unk> just <unk> <unk> your <unk>
If you know they're gay, <unk>
If they tell your parents that maybe they could be gay, they will stay the hope that it could change.
Don't give you a sense of false hope.
And number three, and more important --  Let the complex.
You communicate your truth.
It would never be <unk> for that.
And some of them can come out hurt safe, <unk> so they have done, but I'm never sorry about what they are.
And yeah, maybe some will feel <unk> but that's not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not your own.
That's the story of them, but not of you.
The only story that matters is that you want to write.
So the next time you find in a dark <unk> <unk> a <unk> you must know that we all have been there before.
And you may feel very yourself, but they don't.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
<unk> What is that?
If you look at the story of how intelligence has seen -- an productive example has been the famous quote from <unk> <unk> that "The <unk> question can think of is as interesting as the question of if a submarine can be <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a criticism of computing like Alan <unk>
And so a few years ago, we have a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms of intelligence.
So let's step back a step.
We first start with a thought experiment.
So imagine that they are a space race that you don't know about the biology of the Earth or the neuroscience of the Earth or the intelligence of the Earth, but they have amazing telescopes, and you can see the Earth, and they have incredibly long lives, so you can observe the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason that we are trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're from a alien alien that doesn't know about this, that it doesn't have any concept on the intelligence of the Earth, it would be forced to develop a physical theory that would explain how, until a certain time in time, the asteroids that we <unk> the surface of a <unk> planet, stop doing it.
And so I claim that this is the same question of understanding the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that I took over several years ago, I looked at a variety of issues through science, through various disciplines that <unk> I think, is a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there have been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be <unk> adjusted to the development of intelligence, and, in particular, for the development of universal states that will increase the diversity of future future future.
Finally, in the planning of robotic movement, there have been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize the future freedom of action in order to perform complex tasks.
And so by taking all these different issues and <unk> together, I asked them for several years ago: There's a underlying mechanism for the intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
There's only an equation for <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent of a E = <unk> for the intelligence that I have seen.
So what you're looking at here is a claim that intelligence is a <unk> F, that acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or keeping the open options with a <unk> force, with the diversity of possible future accessible, yes, even an impending time -- the <unk>
In a nutshell, to intelligence you don't like to get <unk>
<unk> is trying to maximize the future freedom of action and maintaining open options.
And so by having this equation, it's natural <unk> what can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
<unk> the level of human <unk>
<unk> <unk> intelligence.
So I'm going to show you now a video that I think, show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology has suggested that the universes that produce <unk> or <unk> for their life should have tendency to more favorable conditions for the existence of intelligent beings like us.
But what if that <unk> <unk> <unk> between entropy and intelligence -- a more <unk> relationship.
What if intelligent behavior is not only correlated with the production of the long term, but actually comes directly from it?
To find out, we've developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of long-term entropy in any system that you can find in.
<unk> <unk> could spend multiple animal tests, play games, and even winning money <unk> actions, all of it without the fact that they could do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a human standing with no <unk> here we see <unk> <unk> automatically a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable in part because we never gave it a goal.
He just decided for his account to balance the <unk>
This ability to balance it will have applications for robotic robotics and technologies of human care.
This ability to use tools of tools will have applications in intelligent manufacturing and agriculture.
In addition, just like some other animals can cooperate on opposite of a rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can perform a version of the model of that task.
This ability of cooperation has interesting consequences for economic planning, and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable at a variety of <unk>
For example, here we actually see it successfully playing a game of <unk> against itself, <unk> their potential for play.
So here we see <unk> orchestrate new connections into a social network where the friends are constantly <unk> and it keeps a success on the <unk>
This same capacity of network <unk> also has applications in health care, energy and intelligence.
Here we see <unk> which is organizing the routes of a fleet of boats, and discovering with success and using the Panama Canal to scale its reach from the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable in defense and transportation and transportation.
Finally, here we see that we see <unk> that will spontaneously discover and run a <unk> strategy.
This ability for risk management is going to have huge applications in finance and safe.
Alex <unk> What you have seen is that a variety of brands of cognitive human behaviors such as the use of tools, walking upright and social cooperation, all led by one single equation, which leads to a system to maximize its future freedom of action.
Now, here's a deep <unk>
So let's go back at the beginning of the term -- <unk> <unk> <unk> -- there was always the concept that if we were going to see intelligent machines, there would be a <unk> rebellion, would be a rebellion, <unk>
The machines were <unk> against us.
One of the greatest consequences of this work is that maybe all these decades, we've had all the concept of rebellion, in the other way.
It's not the machines first become smart, and then they try to take over the world.
It's all right, that the impulse to take the control of all future possible is a more fundamental principle than the intelligence of intelligence, that general intelligence can actually arise directly from taking control, rather than being backwards.
Another important consequence is the search for the goal.
I often ask me, how do you find goals we learn from this kind of <unk>
My equivalent to that statement to move to the descendants to help them build artificial artificial artificial intelligence or helping them understand human intelligence, is this: The intelligence must be seen as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid constraints in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at a tipping point in human history, something between the <unk> of stars and losing the planet that we call <unk>
Because in the last few years, we've extended a lot of our knowledge of how it fits the Earth in the context of the universe.
The Kepler Kepler has discovered thousands of potential planets orbiting other stars, which points that the Earth is only one between the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope that measures the sheer <unk> intensity of the stars when the planets go ahead of them, and they blocking a little bit of that light that will go.
The data gathered by Kepler showing the sizes of planets on top of them and their mother.
And together, this helps us understand if these planets are small and <unk> like the Earth planets in our solar system, and also the amount of light they get from their <unk>
At the time, this gives clues about whether these planets we find are <unk> or not.
Unfortunately, while we're finding this trove of worlds potentially <unk> our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
Last year, 2014, was the hottest <unk>
<unk> and sea ice that has been with us for the millennia, are now disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we've caused on a global scale have <unk> our ability to disrupt their course.
But I'm not a weather scientist, no <unk>
I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by the stars, with the hope of finding places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
You might say that I look for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as someone very interested in the search for life in the universe I can tell you that the more I look for planets like the Earth like the Earth, more enjoying our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invited to a comparison between the planet only discovered and the planets that we know better: our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little bit further from the Sun, it can be considered a potentially livable world shown that by a mission like the Kepler <unk>
In fact, it is possible that Mars has been habitable in the past, and in part, that's why we study Mars so much.
Our <unk> like the <unk> are tracking its surface looking for clues about the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that <unk> like the <unk> mission take samples from the <unk> atmosphere, and try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
Companies now offer not just short space flights but also the <unk> possibility of living on Mars.
But even though all these images are <unk> they remind us to the deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with the <unk> ideas and <unk> compared to the Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the areas of the <unk> areas of our planet that are still in the <unk> places with Mars.
Even in the most <unk> and highest places on the Earth, the air is cool and full of oxygen <unk> for our forests thousands of miles away.
I worry that this excitement of the colonization of Mars and other planets going to get a great and sad and sad <unk> the implication and the belief that the belief that Mars is waiting to save this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know is truly habitable the Earth.
For a lot of I like the exploration, I am deep deep with this idea.
There are a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars will be there to help us get to humanity is as imagine that the captain of the Titanic will tell us that the <unk> captain is going later later on the <unk>   Thank you.
But the goals for <unk> exploration, and the preservation of earth is not <unk>
No, they are actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of understanding, preserve and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments present in our world looks like <unk> aliens.
It's just closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and keep <unk> spaces in the hostile and <unk> spaces of land, maybe we can meet the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
Let me leave you with an <unk> experiment.
A lot of years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi asked me to realize that our universe has been around for a long time, and we hope that there were a lot of planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of the life of the alien life so far.
Well, where are they?
Well, a solution to the Fermi paradox, is that when the civilizations become advanced enough advanced enough to consider to keep living among the stars, they lose the notion of how important it is to protect the origin of the planets that we prescribe this development.
It's arrogant to think that we just colonization, it will save us from ourselves, but the planetary preservation and exploration, <unk> can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to look at the hostile environments of Mars for human presence, then we should be able to overcome the most easy job to preserve the <unk> <unk>
Thank you.
A few years ago, I got my own home.
And while I was on the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window that were at the dining table, where there were <unk>
So I quickly tried to open all the other doors and windows, and they were all pretty closed off.
I thought I would call a <unk> at least I had my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a lot of time to get to, and it was cold.
I couldn't go home from my friend of Jeff to spend the night because I had one flight to Europe in the next morning, and my <unk> my passport and my <unk>
<unk> expensive, but sure are not more expensive than a <unk> at night, so I thought that despite the circumstances, living right over.
I am a <unk> and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
<unk> <unk> that the heart rate increases, <unk> levels of adrenaline and <unk> thinking.
And when I got to the <unk> counter at the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started to ask myself, if there was something I could do, systems that I could put in his place, which was going to happen.
Or at least if bad things happen to be wrong, that you will get the likelihood that it is a total catastrophe of catastrophe as well.
So I started thinking about that, but until a month later, my thoughts not <unk>
I was having dinner with my colleague, Danny <unk> who was the Nobel Prize winner and a little embarrassed he talked about <unk> the window, and I had forgotten my passport, and Danny shared with me who had been practicing with something called <unk>
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written this for a few years earlier, known as the <unk>
You all know what the <unk> is.
Every time there is a disaster, a team of experts come and try to figure out what went wrong, yeah?
In <unk> as it explains <unk> you look forward and try to figure out how things could go wrong, then you try to figure out what it can do to prevent things or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk to you about here is some things we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> they're not so evident.
I'm going to start with the <unk>
At the house, you have a place for things that are very easily.
This sounds of common sense, and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space works.
There's a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to keep tracking the location of the important things, where the fine, where the fish, where the fish, which places the <unk> trees, where the tribes are friends and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that <unk> in the <unk> of London.
It's the part of the brain that allows the <unk> to find their nuts.
And if you ask if someone really did the experiment, they cut the sense of <unk> and they still could find his nuts.
They didn't use the smell, but the hippocampus, the very evolved mechanism of the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move much, not so good for things that they move very much.
This is the reason for losing your car <unk> reading and <unk>
So at home -- a place for the keys, a hook next to the gate, maybe a plate <unk>
You get a <unk>
For your reading goggles.
If you get a place and they're <unk> with that stuff you will always be there when the <unk>
What about the <unk>
Take the cell card, a photo of your credit card cards, license to drive, passport, <unk> <unk> for mail for the <unk>
If these things are lost or <unk> this can make the <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress, your brain frees your brain up.
<unk> is toxic and <unk> thinking.
So part of the <unk> practice is to recognize that under stress we won't be at the best time, and you have to put the systems on the site.
And there are perhaps no more stressful situation than when you're faced with a medical decision.
And at some point, we all will all be in that situation, to have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or a dear one, to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And I'll talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> like a <unk> for all of a decision making, and in fact for changing financial decisions and social decisions -- any kind of decision that you need to take from the <unk> of the facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've got the result of the lab and cholesterol is a little <unk>
Everybody knows that high cholesterol is associated with a greater risk of heart disease attack, heart attack, <unk>
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to <unk> a drug that will help you reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And maybe you have heard of the <unk> and you know that it's one of the most <unk> drugs in the world today, you may even know you know people who are <unk>
So you think, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there's a question that you have to do then, a statistic that you have to ask that most physicians don't want to talk about, and drug companies even less.
It's for <unk> the number needs to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or have to have surgery in any medical procedure before you can help a person.
And you have to think about what kind of statistic statistic is <unk>
Number one must be one.
My doctor didn't tell me something if I wasn't going to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not the fault of the doctor, and if it's <unk> it's from scientists like me.
We haven't understood very well <unk> mechanisms.
But the estimates of <unk> that 90 percent of drugs works only about 30 to 50 percent of the people.
So the number needs to deal with the most widely <unk> what believe it is?
How many people have to take it before you help a person?
300.
This is by the research of cynical researchers <unk> <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I just explored the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before we avoid one single heart attack, stroke brain or another event.
Now you might think, "Well, one of you in 300 <unk> <unk> my <unk>
Why not <unk> <unk> <unk> the recipe for all <unk>
But then you have to ask for one more statistic and it is, <unk> of the <unk> Right?
For this particular drug, the side effects are produced by five percent of patients.
And those include <unk> <unk> <unk> muscle pain and <unk> pain <unk> but they think, <unk> <unk> is not very likely to get me to me, still take the <unk>
But a moment, a moment.
Remember that under stress you don't think clearly.
So think about how to do this with time, so you don't have to make the chain of reasoning in the act.
300 people are taking the drug, right? A person has <unk> five percent of the 300 people have side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to get away by the drug that will help your drug help you.
I don't say they had or not to take the <unk>
I just say that you must have this conversation with your doctor.
The medical ethic is required, it's part of the beginning of informed consent principle.
We have right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about if you want to take the risks or not.
You may be thinking that I've launched this number in the air by the value of the crash, but actually this number needs to deal with is quite typical.
For the surgery that is more done in the older men in 50 percent of the prostate cancer, the number necessary to deal with is <unk>
This is 49 surgeries for a person who has <unk>
And the side effects of that case are produced by 50 percent of the patients.
Those include the helplessness or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you're lucky, and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects only <unk> a year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think before the questions that you can make the conversation to go forward.
You don't have to make this all this thing in the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because it has a lot of times, a lot of times, they want a shorter life from pain, or a longer life that could be a lot of pain in the end?
These are the things that they talk about and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
You can change in the heat of the moment, but at least you're trained in this kind of thinking.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that you turn a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
Happy to face with a predator, you don't need the <unk> system, or the <unk> or the immune system, because if the body is spending the metabolism on those things, it doesn't react fast. You could get to be the lunch of the lions, so none of it matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window during those moments of stress is the rational, rational thinking like Danny <unk> and his colleagues have shown in.
So we have to <unk> to think about the future to this kind of situation.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we are all <unk>
We're all going to fail every time.
The idea is to think about the future, how do you be those <unk> to put the systems in the place that will help to minimize the harm, or to stop that the bad things happen in the first place.
I <unk> at the night of snow in <unk> when I came back from my journey, my contractor installed a <unk> of combination with a <unk> on the door, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of cards that I've not ordered and lots of email messages I haven't read it.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization like a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: <unk> <unk> is my favorite <unk>
It means <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument and you see a <unk> on the <unk> you need to touch <unk>
Two <unk> even <unk>
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing of a tree of <unk> where you see that it doesn't matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> it may be -- it will never get a complete silence.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I would like to share a little bit about the history of the American system of signs, the <unk> in addition to a little bit of my own story.
The French language is arrived in the 1800s, and over the time, it was mixed with local books, and it was developed the language we know as <unk>
So it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> and they taught me to believe that sound was not a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
However, I realize that it's not true for anything.
<unk> are a very important part of my life, really in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a sound world, it's like I lived in a foreign country, following the rules, <unk> behaviors and norms and <unk>
So how do I understand the sound like?
Well, I see how people behave and respond to the sound.
People are like my speakers and they <unk> the sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sound, and I've seen how people <unk>
So I've learned for example -- for example.
"Not <unk> <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise in the bag of potato <unk>
Not <unk> and when you're eating, make sure you didn't get the <unk> in the <unk>
I call this <unk> <unk>
I might think of the sound label more than the average person does it.
I'm super <unk>
And I'm always waiting for <unk> the sound that's going to come next.
From there, this drawing.
<unk> <unk>
<unk> to continue.
<unk> for <unk>
You can see the <unk> don't have notes in the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sounds through the <unk> <unk> and <unk>
In <unk> culture, the movement is equivalent to the sound.
This is the signal for <unk> in <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
But for me, to make it with my thumb that it doesn't feel natural.
That's why I just have four lines on the paper.
In the year 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an art residence there.
Before this time, I had worked like <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and <unk> spaces, and as I went from one place to another, I realized there was no visual art there.
At that moment, the sound was the trend and that called me the <unk>
There was no visual art, it was all <unk>
Now sound has entered my territory of art.
Is it going to be more of the art?
I realized that it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that not just experience through the ears.
I can feel it <unk> or experience it visually, or even like an idea.
So I decided to reclaim the sound and <unk> in my artistic practice.
And everything I had taught me in the sound of sound, I decided to leave it and <unk>
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the art community, I was struck with the amount of support and attention I had.
I realized that sound is like money, power, the <unk> social currency.
On the bottom of my mind, I always felt that sound was <unk> it was something of a listener.
And the sound is so powerful that it could be <unk> to me and my artistic work, or I could get it out.
I chose to be <unk>
There's a massive culture around the speech.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is like I didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me just like and become my voice.
So I am able to be relevant in the current society.
So in school, in work and institutions, I work with many different performers from <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
It will help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, when I was <unk> his voices, I am able to keep a temporary way of value something like taking a loan in a very high interest rate.
If I'm not going to continue this practice, I feel that I could do it in <unk> and not have any kind of social value.
So with sound like my new, artistic <unk> <unk> in the music world.
And I was surprised by looking at the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note cannot catch and express fully on the role.
And the same thing can be said about a concept in <unk>
The two are very <unk> and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect all the significance of the signals like <unk>
I'd like to share with you a <unk> metaphor for me to understand how the <unk> works.
So imagine a piano.
<unk> divide in a lot of different <unk> parameters together.
If it's <unk> a different <unk> for each finger as you touch the piano, like facial expression, the movement of the body, the speed, the shape of the hand and so while it hits the piano, the English is a linear language, as if you just hit the same once.
However, <unk> is more like a <unk> you need 10 fingers <unk> to express a very clear concept or an idea in <unk>
If only a key would change the <unk> it would create a completely different meaning.
The same thing happens with music in terms of and <unk> volume.
In <unk> by using these different <unk> parameters, you can express different ideas.
For example, the signal <unk> in that."
This is the signal <unk> in that."
I'm looking at.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, I <unk>
<unk> oh.
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I look at <unk> through the lenses of music?
If I had to create a sign and you put it over and over again, it could be like a piece of visual music.
For example, this is the <unk> sign of the sun, and you put it in.
This is all the day."
If you put it up, and we <unk> the visually speed, it looks like a piece of music.
All the day.
I feel that the same thing can be said about <unk> <unk>
"All the <unk>
This is all night in this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- <unk> <unk>
I feel that the third has more <unk> than the other two.
This represents what time expresses in <unk> and how the distance body can express the changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> is two hands, the present gets closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
Then, <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last, which is my favorite, with a very romantic and dramatic idea at the same time, <unk> again."
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a specific rhythm of four times by <unk>
However, when I see the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically <unk> same time."
Look at <unk> hand, <unk> right hand <unk>
We have the <unk> through the head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> I'm going to show you a way of the hand called <unk> <unk>
Can you do with me?
All with the <unk>
Now we're going to do it both in my head like the chest, something like <unk> <unk> or <unk> same time."
Yes, very good.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and language language around the world.
The second one I would like to show you is this. Please do it again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in the <unk>
Now, the third. Please <unk> again.
And over again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
Let's do three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
Look at how the three signs are very similar. They all happen in your head and the chest. but they get a very different meanings, too.
It's amazing to see how the <unk> is alive and concerned like music.
However, we live in a very <unk> world.
And just because <unk> doesn't have sound, it automatically doesn't have social value.
We have to start to question what defines social value and allowing the <unk> to develop its own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more <unk> society.
And maybe people will understand that you don't have to be deaf, to learn <unk> not to hear music.
The <unk> is a <unk> <unk> and I'd like you to have the same experience.
I would like to <unk> to open your ear, open the eyes, to participate in our culture and experience our visual language.
And you never know, they can even fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents were saying, "You can <unk> everything, but then you have to <unk>
Freedom involves responsibility.
But my imagination took me all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a bubble of innocence or a bubble of ignorance -- I have to say, because adults would lie to us to protect ourselves from the horrific truth.
When I was getting older, I learned that adults are also <unk> and that they're not very good to clean up the other.
Time country, now I'm an adult and I teach the citizen and the invention of Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait much for my students to walk on the beach <unk> with lots of waste.
So like a good citizens, we put the <unk> and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't get it out.
It's sad to say, but now more than 80 percent of the oceans have plastic.
It's kind of creepy.
And in the last decades, we've been coming out with these big ships and networks, to collect those plastic chunks of plastic to study them under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But it lasts hard and it's very expensive and it's also very risky to use those enormous <unk>
So along with my students, seven to 15 years, we dream about invent a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started building this <unk> of <unk> <unk> so that the children are very <unk> can also participate.
And I'm going to tell you the kids who manipulate electrical tools feel cool and safe.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect the plastic and we reduce it the size that we found in the ocean, which is very small, because of its <unk>
So that we do.
I leave it to the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas in every child, and try to figure out something that we hope to work.
We decided that instead of collecting plastic pieces of plastic -- just <unk> information.
By using a robot, we took a picture of this <unk> the children are very excited with robots.
Then we started what we call "a <unk>
We are so quick at creating prototypes that we ended up before lunch.
And we can transform light and camera cameras, and put it into a floating robot that will move slowly through the water and the plastic that we have there, and this is the picture captured by the robot.
We see the bits of plastic floating floating out through the sensor while the computer on board process this image and measure the size of every single <unk> to get an estimate of the amount of plastic <unk>
<unk> this invention step back on a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone else would get it even more.
The cool thing about this project is that the students saw a local problem, and <unk> are trying to fix it immediately.
I can investigate my problem -- but my students in Hong Kong are very well <unk>
Do you see the news, <unk> the Internet, and it is <unk> with this image: man.
A child, maybe less than 10 years, just using a oil spill, just using your hands in <unk> the largest <unk> forest in Bangladesh.
They were very shocked because this is the water that <unk> is the water in which the water is <unk> where the place where they live.
You can see also the water is brown, the mud and the oil is also the brown color, and when everything is <unk> it's very difficult to see what's in the water.
But there's a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what's in the water.
We built a very first prototype of a <unk> that can be <unk> through all kinds of substances that produce different <unk> what can help identify what's in the water.
We put this prototype with a sensor and we sent it to Bangladesh.
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or to analyze a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help in way to other children.
I was able to investigate a problem with <unk> I was forced to do a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little bit more far, and maybe tackle a more difficult problem, and also closer to me.
I'm half Japanese and French half and probably remember, in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that it started several giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> destroy various cities on the east coast of Japan.
Over 14,000 people died in an instant.
It also gives the nuclear energy plant in Fukushima, a nuclear power <unk>
And today, according to the reports on an average of 300 tons are still leaking from the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, the entire Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution by <unk>
If we go to the west, we can measure the radiation of <unk> everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that most of the radiation disappeared from the Japanese coast, and most of the time, it has safe, it's blue. It's blue.
Well, reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've gone back to <unk> every year from the accident and training in an independent way with other scientists, the land, the river, and this time we wanted to take the kids.
Of course, not the <unk> the parents don't get it.
But every night we went to the <unk> center, you see the use of different <unk>
It might seem that they didn't take a serious job but they did it because they're going to have to live with the <unk> all their life.
Together with them we discuss the data <unk> that day and talk about what we were going to do next, the strategies, the <unk> and so on.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region around the plant plant plant.
We created the map of <unk> pigmented <unk> to represent data in real time of <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
With this we could notice that the radioactive powder is <unk> from the top of the mountain into the <unk> system and <unk> in the ocean.
It was an <unk> <unk>
But based on this, we organized a civil expedition the nearest <unk> to the date.
We are approaching a half miles of nuclear, and with the fishermen help from the area we were collecting <unk> <unk> with a <unk> <unk> with a sediment of sediment as we invented and we built.
So here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem with a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open-source technologies and very simple technologies.
But at the same time, it's been increasingly frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the harm that we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve the problems.
I wonder if we should give the jump, and try to invent better ways to do all these things.
So the classroom became a little bit so much, so that we found an industrial installation in Hong Kong and we became the largest space dedicated to the social impact and environmental impact.
It's in the center of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with wood, metal, chemistry, some biology, of optical <unk> you can build almost all over there.
It's also a place where adults and kids can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of children can actually become the help of adults, and where adults can get kids over again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked things like, we can invent the future of mobility with energy energy.
For example.
Or can we help in mobility at the advanced age transforming their standard wheelchair chairs in new <unk> vehicles.
The plastic, the oil and the <unk> are <unk> terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave our kids are the lies.
We can't afford to protect the children of the horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So citizen citizens, creators, creators, we need to prepare the next generation to be concerned about the environment and people, and so it can really do something about it.
Thank you.
Two <unk> <unk> two cultures of radically opposite design.
One is made out of thousands of steel pieces of steel, the other one of a little silk <unk>
One of them is synthetic -- the other organic one.
One is imposes on the environment, the other person believed it.
One is designed by nature, the other one for it.
Michelangelo said that when he looked at the <unk> <unk> he saw a figure that struggle for being free.
<unk> was only a tool of Michelangelo.
But living creatures are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, cells, we took all the information that would required for each cell to work and to <unk>
The tools also have consequences.
At least from the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by manufacturing and mass production.
The assembly lines have dictated a world made out of parts, <unk> the imagination of designers and architects trained to think about their objects, as <unk> parts of different functions.
But you don't find <unk> material <unk>
Think of the human skin, for example.
Our facial skins are thin <unk>
The skins of the back are <unk> with little <unk>
You acts primarily as filter, the other mostly as barrier, and yet it's the same <unk> there's no parts, no <unk>
It's a system that is gradually gradually its functionality through the variation of <unk>
Here's a split screen that represents my worldview.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the law, and analytics and synthesis, is shown in the two screens after me.
My job at the simplest level, is trying to bring these two visions of the world, moving from assembly and approaching growth.
You probably ask, why now?
Why wasn't it possible for it 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a rare moment, where you get four disciplines that offers designers access to the tools that we never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I create.
Please meet the minds and the hands of my students.
We designed objects, products, structures and tools through large-scale scales, like this robotic arm with a scope of 24 feet in diameter with a force that will someday not very far to print <unk> buildings, and the <unk> made of genetically engineered <unk> that shine down in the dark.
Here we have <unk> the <unk> an archetype of the old Arab architecture, and it's created a screen where every opening is the only size of the light and the heat through it.
In our next project, we explore the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> -- this was for a <unk> fashion fashion fashion tape <unk> It's like a second skin made from one piece, <unk> in the flexible <unk> around the waist.
Along with 3D printing <unk> we print this layer and 3D <unk> with no seams between cells, and I'll show you more objects like that.
This helmet combines <unk> and <unk> materials in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a scanner <unk>
That designers have access to this <unk> <unk> and <unk> instruments allow us to design products that are <unk> not only the way our bodies, but also the physiological structure of our tissues.
We've also designed a acoustic chair -- a chair at the same time, comfortable and also absorb sound.
The professor Carter -- my collaborator, went back to the nature of <unk> and the design of this <unk> pattern becomes <unk>
<unk> this surface of 44 different properties that vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> the pressure points in the human body.
Their surface, like in nature, is going on its functionality not through the addition of another material or another <unk> but it will continuously keep up and <unk> the material itself.
But it's nature <unk>
There are no parts of nature?
I didn't raised in a religious Jew home, but when I was young, my grandmother told me stories about the Bible <unk> and one of them became a lot of what it really matters.
As she <unk> "In the third day of <unk> God sent the Earth to grow a <unk> tree <unk>
For that first tree -- there was no difference between trunk, <unk> leaves and <unk>
The whole tree was a <unk>
Instead, the land did grow trees with <unk> cortex, <unk> and flowers.
The earth created a world made out of it.
I often ask, "What would be the design if objects were made by a single part?
<unk> a better state of the <unk>
So we look for the material to do the type of material the tree of the tree with fruit and and we found it.
The second <unk> more abundant on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons that are produced every year of organisms like shrimp, or <unk> <unk> and <unk>
We thought that if we could tune into their properties, we could generate structures in a single piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it <unk> <unk>  <unk> a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> and produced <unk>
It turns out the chemical concentrations we've been able to achieve a wide range of properties, from dark, hard and <unk> to the light, soft and transparent.
In order to print the large-scale structures a system with multiple <unk> of <unk> <unk>
The robot could actually change the properties of the material on the march, and create these structures made from one three three three three <unk>
When the pieces are ready, it will dry it to find a natural form in contact with the air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process was used to contain <unk> <unk> that first came out on the planet three billion years ago, as we heard yesterday.
Along with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, we <unk> the bacteria designed to capture rapidly from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we have been able to generate structures that make their transition without problems of <unk> <unk> and if it grows even further, to windows.
A <unk> tree <unk>
Working with a old material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and a little bit of synthetic biology, we have transformed a <unk> structure of shrimp in an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here is the best two: for objects that are designed to <unk> put in the sea, and they will <unk> life and put it on the ground, they will grow a tree.
The match for our next exploration using the same design principles was the solar system.
We are looking for the possibility of creating clothes to keep life for the <unk>
To do that, we need to master the bacteria and control their flow.
So like the <unk> <unk> we did our own table of <unk> new forms of life created <unk> made <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think about synthetic biology like the liquid <unk> only that instead of <unk> metals -- <unk> <unk> new basic rules, within very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
We <unk> our own 3D channels to control the flow of these <unk> <unk>
In our first piece of laundry is <unk> two microorganisms.
The first is <unk>
It lives in our oceans and in the ponds of fresh water.
And the second, E. <unk> the bacteria that <unk> in the human intestine.
One turns the light in sugar, the other layer sugar and produces useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two <unk> are not interacting in nature.
In fact, they never <unk>
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not by natural selection, but evolution by design.
To hold these relationships, we have created a single channel that looks like the tract tract that will help you make these bacteria and to make it <unk> their function as well.
So we started to grow those channels in the human body, <unk> the properties of the material by <unk>
If we wanted more <unk> <unk>
This system <unk> <unk> when you stretch from one end to each other, like 60 meters.
This is half the length of a football field, and 10 times more than our small <unk>
And here it is, as a <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> channels in your clothes.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are old <unk> creatures -- only half is <unk>
What if the design would make the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase the <unk>
And if we could create personal <unk> that we <unk> our skin, they will destroy the damage and <unk> our <unk>
Think about this as a way of editing biology.
I call this the material ecology.
To do that, you always have to go back to nature.
So right now, you know that a 3D printer does it do <unk>
You also know that nature doesn't do that.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture within which it was <unk>
The manufacturing is not <unk> about this level of <unk>
It does it by the combination of not two materials, but of two proteins in different <unk>
A <unk> like a structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, put those fibers together.
And this happens across scales.
The silk worm first goes into the environment, creates a <unk> structure, and then it starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and the <unk> the two forces in life is <unk> in a single material.
In order to understand better how this complex process works, we attach a small magnet to the head of a silk <unk>
We put it inside a box with magnetic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualize the complex architecture of the cocoon of <unk>
However, when you put the silk worm on a flat patch -- not within a box, we realized that we <unk> a flat cocoon and still <unk> <unk>
So we started to design different parts of us, different <unk> and we've discovered that the way, the composition, the <unk> structure was transmitted directly by the environment.
It's often <unk> the silk worms to death within their <unk> their silk <unk> and it's used in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these templates we can shape the raw silk without boiling a single <unk>
It was <unk> and we could create these things.
So we brought this process up to the architectural scale.
We had a <unk> robot making silk <unk> and we put ourselves on our place.
We knew that silk worms are moving into more dark areas and <unk> so we use a road diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat in our structure.
So we created holes or <unk> to block the rays of light and heat it through the silk worms on the structure.
We were ready to get the <unk>
<unk> <unk> worms of silk farm online.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were ready to <unk> with us.
We put them carefully at the lower edge of the <unk> and as they <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and life starts again, like us, but much more short.
<unk> Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and it was right.
By <unk> biological silk about silk <unk> <unk> you give all this <unk> and our integrity.
And in a little more than two or three weeks, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the <unk>
The <unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 extra <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A <unk> silk by a robotic arm, the other <unk> empty.
If the last frontier of design is to give the products and the buildings around us, to form an ecology of two materials, the designers must bring these two visions of the world.
Which brings us back, of course, at the beginning.
Here is a new era of design, a new era of creation, which brings us from a design inspired by nature to a nature inspired by design, which demands for us, for the first time, that we make care of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Hands up if you've ever wondered "What do you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember how old they were when they asked them for the first time.
You can get it with your fingers.
Three. Five. Three. Five. Five.
Now, raise your hand if the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
It's caused by some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm someone who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem wasn't that I didn't have any interest, but I had <unk>
In school I loved English, the <unk> and the art and the online websites -- also playing the guitar in a punk band called <unk> <unk>
You may have heard of us.
And in general, I like to test and persist anyway. I have dedicated a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But with the time this feeling of <unk> this feeling of, this is no challenge, it gets to <unk>
And I have to give it up.
But then I was excited about something else, something completely different, and I got to focus on it, and I just let me absorb and feel <unk> I've found it <unk> and then again, this point where I start to <unk>
And finally, I want to give it up.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern led to a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first one was because I wasn't sure how it was going to turn this whole thing into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, denying all my other passions and <unk> <unk>
Another reason that I had as much anxiety was a little bit more personal.
I was worried that there was something wrong with this, and something bad about me is not <unk> at all.
I was worried to be afraid of commitment, or to be <unk> or <unk> or to my own success.
If you can relate my story and these feelings, I'd like to ask you something that I'd like to ask you to have asked me then.
<unk> themselves, where they learned to allocate the meaning of <unk> or abnormal to do things.
I'll tell you where they <unk> they learned about the culture.
Do you ask first "What do you want to be <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody cares about what it would happen to that age.
It's considered a naive question to cause nice answers in children like, <unk> or <unk> or <unk> or want to be <unk>
It <unk> the <unk> <unk> here.
This question is done over and over again as we grow in various ways, <unk> <unk> to high school students are asked to pick up in college.
And at some point, "What do you want to be <unk>
It happens to be the cute exercise of before what you care about sleep.
Why?
If this question is inspired by children to dream with what might be, it's not inspired by dreaming of everything they might be.
In fact, it does right on the contrary, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't respond with 20 different things, even though <unk> adults might be <unk> and say, "Oh, what cute, but you can't be a <unk> and <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  and he's a <unk> and <unk>
And this <unk> <unk> editor turned into <unk> <unk> and creative <unk>
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is that they're going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of fate or the real <unk> the idea that each one of us has something to do with the time in this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is and devote your life to it.
But what if you're not connected to this way?
What if there are a lot of different themes that you bring up with curiosity and lots of different things that want to do?
There's no place for someone like one in that framework.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel that it doesn't have a goal.
And feel there's something wrong with you.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You're a <unk>
A <unk> is someone with a lot of interests and creative activities.
It's a <unk> so I said.
It could help if divide in three <unk> multiple <unk> potential.
You can also use other terms of <unk> the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
During the time in the Renaissance the ideal was the ideal was <unk> in multiple fields.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as a <unk>
<unk> any term you like or <unk> your own.
It seems like a kind of adapt to a community, we can't agree with a single identity.
It's easy to see <unk> like limitation or woe that you should win.
But what I've learned about talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there are huge strengths in this way.
Here are three superpowers <unk>
One: the synthesis of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and creating something new in the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> their shared interests on cartography, visualization of data, travel, mathematics and design, when they found <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates jewelry <unk>
<unk> and Rachel came up with this unique idea for his <unk> mixture of skills and experiences.
Innovation is happening at intersections.
So there comes new ideas.
And the <unk> with all their background, can access a lot of these points of <unk>
The second <unk> <unk> is learning learning.
When we <unk> we are interested in something, we go to it.
We look at everything we can have in our hands.
We're used to being <unk> because it was a lot of times in the past, and this means that we have less afraid of proving new things and coming out of our comfort.
So many skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring everything that we've learned to every new area that we have, so we rarely start out of zero.
<unk> <unk> is a <unk> in full time and author and independent <unk>
As a child <unk> <unk> an incredible capacity to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest <unk>
Before it became a writer, <unk> was <unk>
He had to learn the finest sales mechanics when they were starting their practices, and this ability to write the compelling <unk> the editors
<unk> is very rarely a loss of time to go to what you can even get in the end, even if you end it up.
It is possible to apply that knowledge in a completely different field, in a way that you could not have <unk>
The third superpower <unk> is adaptability. I mean, the ability to turn into anything you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes director of videos, so many of the pages of websites -- sometimes consultant from Kickstarter, sometimes <unk> and, sometimes, the apparently James <unk>
It's valuable because it does a good job.
He's even more valuable because it can take different <unk> depending on the needs of their clients.
<unk> Magazine defines adaptability as the most important ability for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so quickly and <unk> which are the individuals and organizations that are able to be able to meet the market needs the ones that really <unk>
<unk> of ideas, faster learning and <unk> three skills where the <unk> are very <unk> and three skills you could lose if they're pushed to reduce their targets.
As a society, we have a great interest in foster <unk> to be themselves.
We have complex problems, we have <unk> right now, and we need creative thinkers to deal with them.
Let's say they are, in your heart, <unk>
<unk> from the <unk> knowing that they wanted to be <unk> <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong at you either.
In fact, some of the best teams of a specialist, and a <unk> <unk>
The specialist, he's able to dive deep and put ideas, and the <unk> offers a amplitude of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we all have to design lives and careers that we do with the way we are connected.
And unfortunately, to the <unk> in a large part of them being told that they're just more like their <unk>
Once there is one thing that you will take from this talk, I hope it is this: <unk> with the inner wiring whatever it is.
If you're a heart attack, then you get it all over the media.
That's where you do the best of itself.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those that you just realize is one of them in the last 12 minutes,  -- I tell you, <unk> with your whole passions.
Keep in their curiosity for those <unk> <unk>
<unk> the intersections.
We <unk> our inner wiring leads us to a more authentic and happy life.
And perhaps most importantly, the world is <unk>
Thank you.
In the year I went to a woman named <unk> they took a psychiatric psychiatric <unk>
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of their life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for it until unfortunately passed away in <unk>
After his death, <unk> did a <unk> and found strange <unk> and <unk> in the <unk> brain, of a guy who had never seen before.
The most amazing thing.
If we had been living there today, we couldn't give it more help that he was <unk> he gave him <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's disease.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to get a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's disease.
From <unk> medicine has made a lot.
They have found antibiotics and vaccines to protect ourselves from the <unk> many treatments for cancer, <unk> for HIV, <unk> for <unk> and much more.
But it has been progress in treating Alzheimer's disease.
I'm part of a team of scientists working to find a cure for Alzheimer's for a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's now affects 40 million worldwide.
But 2050, it will affect 150 million that by the way, including many of you.
If you expect to live until 85 or more, the possibility of Alzheimer's disease will be almost one of each other.
In other words, there is the likelihood that it is the chance that you have Alzheimer's or helping to take care of a friend or be loved with Alzheimer's.
Just in America, Alzheimer's disease costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of healthcare is lost in Alzheimer's disease.
Today is the most expensive disease and their costs <unk> an increase in five times by 2050, as the generation of the <unk> <unk>
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the greatest doctors and social challenges of our generation.
But it's been relatively little to <unk>
Today, one of the first 10 causes of death across the world, Alzheimer's is the only disease that you cannot be able to cure or even slow down their development.
We understand less than Alzheimer's than the disease that we do because we spend less time and money on the research.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in cancer that is in Alzheimer's despite the fact that it costs us more Alzheimer's and cause an annual number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what time people knows, but everyone <unk> Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last <unk> years, all the scientists, Alzheimer's disease with aging.
We think it will be <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But there's only looking at a picture of a <unk> healthy brain, compared to a Alzheimer's patient to see the real physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to making a severe loss of memory and mental abilities the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's reduce significantly life expectancy and is always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found <unk> and <unk> strangers in the <unk> brain, a century ago.
For almost a century, we didn't know a lot about this.
We now know that they're made of protein molecules.
Can you think a protein molecule like a piece of paper that folds up like origami.
There are places on the paper that are <unk>
And when it folds right, these <unk> dots end up inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some <unk> dots stay outside the outside.
This makes the protein molecules <unk> each other, forming groups that can form large plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There are many steps, and the identification of what step block is complex, like <unk> a bomb.
<unk> a cable could do anything.
<unk> others can make the bomb <unk>
You have to find the right step that I would do, and then create a drug that does it.
Until recently, most of them have shrunk the wires and expected the best.
But now there's a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, <unk> physical chemicals, and mathematicians.
And together, we've achieved a critical step in the process. It's testing a new kind of drugs that blocking specifically this step to stop the disease.
Let me show you some of our last results.
No one out of our lab has seen it yet.
Let's see a few videos from what happened when these drugs were in <unk>
These are the healthy worms and you can see that they move in normal.
These differences, on the other hand, have some protein molecules that stick each other into them, like humans with Alzheimer's disease.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But by giving our new drugs to these worms at a early stage, then we see that they <unk> and live a normal life.
This is just a positive outcome, but the research like this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years of wait, there's real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to grow that hope, to conquer the Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
This is not scientists like me, this is about you.
We need to convince you that Alzheimer's is a disease and that if we <unk> it can be <unk>
In the case of other disease, patients and family have Wired more research and <unk> pressure on governments, industry, and pharmaceutical industry and <unk>
That was essential to move into HIV treatment in the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to defeat cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't speak for themselves.
And their families, the hidden victims of their loved ones day and night, they're often too <unk> to go out and advocate for change.
So it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not most cases of genetic disease.
All the world with a brain runs the risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients like <unk> that cannot create the change they need for themselves.
<unk> talking for them, and help to demand a cure.
Thank you.
So I took this article in the U.K. science, in January of this year.
To fall in love with someone, do this.
The article is an article that is designed to create romantic love in the lab, and from my own experience when we try to test it at the night of last summer.
So the procedure is quite simple: Two strangers are <unk> to be <unk> more and more personal questions, and then both look at the eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions.
Number four: If you could wake up tomorrow with one quality or skill, what would be?
Number <unk> When was the last time you get to another person?
And <unk>
<unk> that is <unk> these are increasingly personal <unk>
Number four: <unk> really <unk> to your partner what you like him or her -- I know very honest this time, and I gave things that you wouldn't say to someone you've ever met.
When I came across this study a few years ago, a really <unk> detail that two of the participants had married six months later, and invited all of the lab to the <unk>
So it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, it was also <unk>
And when I had the time to test this study, with someone who knew particularly very well, I didn't expect to <unk>
However, we went to <unk> and  And I thought it was a good story, so I send it to the Love column.
That was published in January, and now it's already <unk> so I guess some of you probably are asking yourself, they are still still going.
And the reason I think you ask this is because I've done this question over and over over the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to the subject.
One week before the article was published very nervous.
I had been working on a romantic book in the last few years, so I had been invited to write about my experience in romantic love on my blog.
But a blog can get to a few hundred views like a long, and those were usually just from my Facebook friends and imagined that my article in the New York Times would probably have a few thousands of views.
And that came a good attention of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But I had no idea.
The article was published on Friday at night, and then the Saturday, this happened in my blog.
On Sunday, I had been called <unk> Show and "Good <unk> <unk>
In a month, the article was over eight million <unk> and I was, for saying something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to foster trust writing <unk> about own <unk> experiences, but something else is to discover that life loving one has been international news -- and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people were called or <unk> what they did every day for weeks, the same question: don't just follow together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I made a quick search for the <unk> of my email with the phrase, <unk> still <unk>
And several messages came out immediately.
They were from students and journalists and strangers like this.
I was interviewed on radio and <unk>
I actually gave a talk, and a woman screamed at the stage, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately got red.
I understand this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in an international day, you should expect people to feel comfortable asking about it.
But I wasn't prepared for the wingspan of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to have <unk> life.
In fact, New York Times published a <unk> article for San <unk> that included the experiences of readers when I test the study in them with different degrees of success.
So my first impulse to this whole attention was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not to every request that they both did a public emergence together.
<unk> TV shows, and <unk> the photos of photographs of us two.
I think I was afraid of becoming the <unk> of the <unk> process, a range for which I didn't feel at all <unk>
And I understand that people didn't want to know only if the study worked -- they wanted to know if they really <unk> I mean, if it was able to produce love, not just an adventure, but love love, love <unk>
But this was a question I didn't feel capable of respond.
My relationship was just a few months old, and I felt, especially the wrong question.
How do you know if you put it together or not, and also <unk>
If the answer was not, I would make the experience of doing these 36 questions less interesting?
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997. And there, the researcher goal was not to produce romantic love.
Instead, I was looking for interpersonal approach, among college students, using what <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It sounds <unk> right?
But the study did work.
The participants had felt closer after doing that, several later studies, also used protocol <unk> <unk> as a quick way of creating trust and interaction between strangers.
They have used it between members of the police and the community, and they have used it between people of the opposite policy.
The original version of the story, which I tried last summer, that combines personal questions with four minutes of eye contact, was cited in this article, but unfortunately we never published it.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk at a little liberal arts university, and then a student came to me and said to me with <unk> <unk> the studio and didn't work.
He looked like that for it.
And I said, "Do you want to say that you get rid of the person who is <unk>
Well he did a pause.
I think she just wants to be friends.
And I said, but it became better friends?
<unk> that were able to get better better after proving the <unk>
<unk>
So, <unk> I said.
But I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for when it comes to love.
I found myself with the first time when I was 29 and I was going through a really hard separation.
I had that relationship since I had 20, which was all my first adulthood, and he was my first real love, and I had no idea how or if I could live without it.
So I went into science.
So I did all of the things I could find about the science of romantic love, and I expected that that could sort of <unk> the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the time I thought I just did for the book that I wrote in <unk> it seems really <unk>
I thought that if I was excited about the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel so bad and used to just like I sat back then.
And all this knowledge has been useful in one or a different way.
I'm more patient with love.
I have more confidence to demand what I after.
But I can also see me more clearly, and I can realize that what I look for is sometimes more than reasonably much than reasonably can demand me.
What I'm looking for in love is a <unk> not just to be <unk> today and to be <unk> tomorrow, but to keep being <unk> on the person I love.
It may be the promise that people ask when they wanted to know if they were still together.
The story that media talked about 36 questions is that there may be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way in some way to mitigate some of the risk of <unk> and this is a very <unk> story because it makes us feel <unk> but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of the story.
The story of the story that you ask, are still still together?
And its content with an answer of Yes or No.
So more than a question, we need to make questions, more difficult questions, like, how do you decide who deserves your love and who not?
How do we love in love when things are <unk> and how do you know when to cut and <unk>
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably leads to one relationship?
I don't necessarily know the answers to these questions, but I think they are a good beginning to have a <unk> conversation about what it means to love someone.
So if you want the short version of the history of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, a well-known study and I applied a study designed to create romantic love, we <unk> we still follow together, and I'm very <unk>
But fall in love is not the same thing to remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my article -- love didn't happen.
<unk> in love, because we take the choice to be.
And I <unk> a little bit of reading it now, not because it wasn't true, but at the moment, there was no thought of anything I was supposed to do.
I didn't think for many times we have to take that decision, and how much times it will have to keep doing that choice without knowing before he would always choose or not.
I want you to be enough to have done and responded for 36 questions, have chosen to love somebody as generous, kind and fun and have expressed that choice in the largest daily daily journal.
But what I've done, in change, is to turn my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't really do.
And what they <unk> and what maybe I will spend my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want to be happy implicit in the title of my paper, which is, by the way, the only part of the article that I didn't really wrote.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to choose to someone, and the hope that he will also love, and it's frightening, but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by a pair of <unk> and I was sort of like a forest <unk>
It really affected the city in New York a time.  One thing that really affected me but more detail later on.
I'm going to start with when I was eight years old.
I took a box of wood, and he <unk> a dollar bill a <unk> and a fork in a place in Colorado.
And I thought that some strange <unk> or some aliens would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species <unk> ideas, for example, how we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
Anyway, it has grace because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still making boxes.
At a moment, I was in <unk> <unk> like to go out of tour and to <unk> and all of those <unk> things, and I was doing a collage for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took all the pages and I took a kind of <unk> <unk> to the style Martin, and Agnes Martin, the <unk> <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid of the bees and it is <unk> to them, so I added more resin on the canvas, thinking I could be <unk>
Instead, the opposite of the opposite is the opposite of the opposite of the opposite of size, as if you were to get the text with a <unk>
So I did I built more boxes.
This time, I started adding some electronic elements, frogs, weird bottles that I was finding out the street, everything I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to <unk> and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God of mine can draw in space.
Can I flow <unk> drawing just like a <unk> <unk> <unk>
And I took objects and created my own taxonomy of specimens <unk>
First of all, let me get a idea.
Then I made some insects and weird creatures.
It was very fun to draw on the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and those things, and I was earning some money out of money, to bring my girlfriend over for dinner, for example, going to <unk>
It was great man.
At some point, I became interested in the human form of <unk> sculptures of natural beings with drawings of human beings inside the layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I <unk>
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill me.
And I was going to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
And I started drawing on the glass layers, similar to the drawing on a window and then another window and another window, and I had all these windows together that they make a three-dimensional <unk>
And this really worked -- and so I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work was very big, I call <unk>
For the <unk> I became a great measure in <unk> <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the Museum of the <unk> in Spain.
You know?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's kind of ahead of your time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs <unk> pounds.
<unk> meters long.
It has double a face, so it's 10 meters of composition.
It's a little bit weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
The left, is Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all these creatures with head of animals travel between two worlds.
They go out of the world of representation, this <unk> mesh <unk> where they <unk>
This is where the animal in the heads of the animals are headed to the <unk> lists for suicide <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is made of thousands of elements.
This is a god bird tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> platform of the <unk> <unk> the hut of Osama bin Laden, there are all kinds of rare things that you can see if you look very well in the ocean.
Anyway, also sort of a <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in a hand while the other hand will be clouds.
Their hands are like <unk> and it looks like a <unk> that keeps the Earth and the cosmos in equilibrium.
So it's one aspect of the <unk>
It's a little bit of a narrative.
That's the hand that I <unk>
And then, when you go to the other side, it has a <unk> like a bird <unk> and it spits out clouds of this <unk>
It also has a <unk> tail of a long snake that joins the <unk>
Anyway, their tail is turning on fire on a <unk>
I don't know why I did that.
Things that go on, you know.
His tail ends up in a <unk> eyeball made out of terrorists in 1986.
They've <unk> them.
They were done in the 1980s, as if they were the baseball cards of terrorists.
Very <unk> over time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a <unk> project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is an archive of our culture, through media and material in terms of <unk> dictionaries.
But each one is acting as a kind of file in a form of human being, and you travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at once.
They're like cells, they come together, they <unk>
And you can walk between them. It's getting years old.
Each one is basically a microscope <unk> that weighs 1.3 pounds with a human trapped inside.
This has a little cave in the chest.
That's the <unk> there's the chest, you can get it down the entrance <unk>
I'm going to see you over the rest of the body -- there's a waterfall coming out of the chest, and you cover the penis or <unk> or whatever it is -- a kind of thing <unk>
This is a quick practice of these works because I can't afford it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a <unk> body.
This has two heads and it's communicating between the two.
There are some pills coming out and they come into the head of this strange statue there.
There's a little forest on the <unk> <unk>
Can you <unk>
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> just like the boxes we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick of brick. It's called <unk> <unk>
Within this box there is a physical, a neuroscientist, a painter, a musician, a <unk> a <unk> a radio, a <unk> a <unk> an arm arm that spreads all the content that we do in the world and a garden.
<unk> the box and all the people inside hits each other like particles.
And I think that's the way to change the world.
When you're <unk> who is and the box that you're living in.
And together we got to realize that we're all together in this, that this illusion that we are different, these concepts of the countries, of religion, it doesn't work.
We're all very made out of the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't start to exchange those things with sweetness and <unk> we all will die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do they do when they hurt your head?
They take a <unk>
But for that pill to have the pain of the pain, the bowels and other organs.
Take a pill is the most effective system and <unk> for any drug <unk> effect on your body.
The <unk> though, is that the <unk> any drug is <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in HIV patients.
When you take <unk> drugs, these are <unk> to lower the amount of viruses in the blood, and increase the count of stem cells.
But they are also known for their side effects, most of the negative, because in time it takes to get the current <unk> it gets <unk> and worse still for the time that you take it to their destination, which is where it's most important, in the HIV <unk>
These are regions of the body like the lymph nodes. the nervous system, the lungs, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't easily go into the bloodstream, of patients that are <unk> to regular therapy as antiretroviral drugs.
However, after the disruption of the treatment the virus can wake up and infect new bacterial cells.
This is the big problem of HIV treatment with the current drugs that are a <unk> treatment for the <unk>
One day, I sat down and I thought, <unk> do the treatment directly to the <unk> of the virus, without the risk of <unk> of <unk>
As a scientific expert in <unk> the answer was in front of me, the <unk> of course.
If you use it in <unk> for <unk> wounds and diabetes <unk> you can use for any <unk> thing, including transportation <unk>
In fact, we're using laser pulses to open up or drill into extremely small holes that open and close and close to the infected cells with HIV to introduce medicines.
The best people wonder, "What is that <unk>
We send a small and powerful beam of laser membrane with HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser goes through the cell, while the cell absorbs the drug on a matter of microseconds.
Before you even realize it, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this technology in vitro and <unk> <unk> but the goal is to bring this technology into the human body, apply it to the human body.
"What is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is, through a <unk> device.
With the first head, which is our laser, we're going to do a <unk> in the infection.
The second head, which is a camera, it is moving into the infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> which is <unk> it releases it directly on the site of infection, while the laser is using it again to keep the open cells.
Well, this doesn't seem like a lot of time.
But one day, if it's successful, this technology can lead to total HIV <unk>
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of all <unk> researcher in our case, a laser treatment treatment ...
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've been studying armed groups in the last decade, like terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
<unk> what these groups do when they're not <unk>
My goal is to understand a better way to these <unk> violence and study ways to encourage the transition from violent participation.
I do work work in the world of politics and in the library.
Understanding these groups is key to solving almost all conflict conflict in course, because the war has changed.
It used to be a dispute between states.
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between the states and actors that are <unk>
For example, of the <unk> arrangements of <unk> peace arrangements and 2011, <unk> had signed up between a state and a non-governmental actor.
So we need to understand these <unk> we even need to be <unk> or <unk> in any process of resolution of mass conflict.
But how do we do it?
We need to know what it motivates these organizations.
We know very well for the reasons why they do it, but no one analyzes what they do when they don't <unk>
The arms armed and policies not armed <unk>
Everything is part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global vision.
<unk> groups today are complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known for his violent <unk> against Israel.
Since its creation in the 1980s, they have also established a political game, a network of social services and a military device.
Likewise, the Palestinian <unk> known by his suicide attacks, against Israel, also runs the <unk> of Gaza since 2007.
So these groups make more than just shooting.
They're multitasking people.
We <unk> a complex stream of <unk> <unk> stations, TV channels web websites and strategies on social networks.
And here you have the <unk> magazine in English and published to <unk>
<unk> groups are also investing in a complex fundraising of funds without <unk> but by example, business companies for example, building companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, to increase their funds, to recruit better and build their brand.
<unk> groups also do something else: they create stronger ties with their population investing in social services.
They build schools, run hospitals, run hospitals, professional training programs or <unk>
<unk> offers all these services and more.
<unk> groups also try to conquer the population by offering something that the state of not <unk> security and protection.
The rise of the Taliban in a Afghanistan torn around Afghanistan or even the beginning of the promotion of <unk> can also be viewed by the efforts of these groups to provide safety.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has a high income price for the population.
But in general, providing social services means filling up a <unk> a <unk> gap by government, and lets these groups strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the election victory of <unk> of Palestinian Hamas cannot be understood without recognizing the social work of the group.
It's a really complex situation, even in the West, when we look at the <unk> groups, we just think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, the strategy.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because they fill <unk> gaps through government, and they emerge like armed and political groups, participate in the violent struggle and give governance.
And the more complex and sophisticated organizations, they are these organizations, less we can <unk> as something unlike a state.
How do you call a group like <unk>
<unk> part of a territory -- they run all of its functions collect the trash system.
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states, of nations with no state and hybrids and the weaker ones are states, like in the Middle East today, the more <unk> that gap did the actors.
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups will have to invest more on no military tools.
<unk> that gap of government has to be in the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and make the peace.
If we better understand existing groups, we will understand better what they can offer to foster the transition from violence to nonviolent violence.
In this new dispute between states and actors are not <unk> military power can win some fights, but we're not giving peace or stability.
To make these goals we need long-term investments to fill that <unk> to fill that gap of government that allowed these groups to thrive in a beginning.
Thank you.
I'm a failure.
My opinions about gender equality are <unk> but I'm afraid to accept the label <unk> would be <unk>
I'm <unk> but a pretty bad <unk>
And therefore I was doing it as a bad feminist.
Or at least I wrote a paper, and a book called "The <unk> and then in the interviews, people started to call me the <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant to myself, and a <unk> <unk> has become a bigger thing.
Let me give one step back.
When I was a young man, especially in my youth and the 20 years, I had strange ideas about <unk> these women <unk> <unk> with the men and the <unk> as if that was a bad thing.
Today, I see how women are treated and women around the world and anger, in particular, it looks like a perfectly reasonable response.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that was using people to <unk> that might be a feminist.
It will be labeled as a feminist was a <unk> a nasty <unk>
I <unk> like a woman who doesn't follow the rules, who asked too much, with high self-worth and dare to believe that it's equal or higher to a man.
No one wants to be that woman <unk> until you realize that it's actually that woman and can't imagine being another person.
Over time, as I grew up, I started to accept that I am, in fact, <unk> and also, proud to be.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
<unk> the same wages for the same work.
We have a right to travel around the world as it was free to <unk> or violence.
We have right to use very easy to use and accessible the contraceptives and <unk> services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, no need for <unk> controls or doctrines of <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to have in account our other <unk>
We're not just women.
We are people with a different body -- expression of gender, religion and <unk> a social condition, skills and so much more.
We need to have in account these differences and how we get ourselves in the same way that matters what we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism is not nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear: I'm a disaster.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist.
I have another confession.
When I drive the work, I listen to work, listen to rap <unk>
Although the letter degrades the women and it offends me, the classic <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> is amazing.
<unk> reality with your t-shirt.
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you get the <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I'm completely overwhelmed by my musical <unk>
I firmly believe in the man's work, which is all I don't want to do -- <unk> --  -- all the <unk> tasks -- but also killing insects, the <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
The pink is my favorite color.
<unk> from fashion magazines and things like this.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies of the fairy tales that they come true.
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt his husband, it's his choice, and I'm not who to be <unk>
If a woman decides to stay home to raise his kids, they agreed that election, too.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so that it makes women economically vulnerable when they <unk>
So let's get this problem.
<unk> the conventional feminism that has ignored or <unk> historically the needs of women of color, the gay workers, gay workers, and <unk> for white women, <unk> <unk>
Listen, if that's a good feminism is a very bad <unk>
It is also the following thing: <unk> I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this trend of <unk> <unk> in a <unk>
We hope that it will be <unk>
When we get rid of the <unk> with a lot of taste from the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I already consider to be <unk> of that <unk> before I try to put myself there.
<unk> women, particularly innovative people and the leaders of the sector, are afraid of being tagged as <unk>
They are afraid of standing up and saying, "Yes, I'm <unk> for fear of what that tag is for fear of not being able to be able to do with the <unk> expectations of it.
Let's take an example for example, or like I call her, <unk>
In the last few years, it's a feminist feminist <unk>
In <unk> Music <unk> 2014, in <unk> <unk> in front of the word <unk> <unk>
It was a <unk> show to see this pop star embracing the feminism and to know the women and young men who will be feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, critical critics started endless arguments if they were <unk> it was or not a feminist.
<unk> his feminism, instead of simply believing the word of an adult woman and <unk>
<unk> perfection because we're still struggling for a lot, we want a lot, we need so <unk>
We go much beyond the sane criticism and <unk> to the feminism of any wife, <unk> until it's not left there.
We don't need to do that.
The bad thing is wrong with the wrong thing, a <unk> feminism is the point of <unk>
But what happens next?
We went to recognize our <unk> to give the action and being a little bit more brave.
If I listen to music, I am creating a demand for artists that would be more happy providing a <unk> supply.
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until they <unk> change effectively affecting their profits.
It's certainly hard.
Why does his music be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worst choice.
But when bad decisions justify this makes it harder for women to make gender equality, the equality that we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think of my <unk> three and four years.
These are two <unk> <unk> <unk> and brilliant, and also very <unk> I want you to grow in a world.
They are <unk> by the strong creatures that they are.
I think of them, all of a sudden, the best choice <unk> as something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program is about sexual violence against women like sport, <unk> the <unk> of <unk>
We can change the radio <unk> when we hear songs that treat women like nothing.
We can spend our money to go to the cinema in another part when movies don't treat women more than like <unk> objects.
We can stop supporting professional sports sports where they treat their peers as <unk>
In any case, the men, especially the white men can say, "No, I'm not going to post in their magazine participate in their project, or work with you, until you don't have a number enough of women, both to participate like to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a wider range of people."
Those of us who are <unk> but they are going to be able to participate in these kinds of projects, we can also be able to be <unk> to be even more like we are <unk> to overcome barriers to <unk>
Because we're not <unk> <unk> Without these efforts, without embracing these <unk> our achievements will mean very little.
We can make these little <unk> acts of courage and hope that our choices will come to the top, and people in the power of directors and film producers and music, <unk> the <unk> the people who can make great decisions and more brave for creating a durable and significant change.
We can also be able to tell us the courage of feminism, good, bad, or from any <unk>
The last line of my book <unk> <unk> says, <unk> will be a bad feminist unless you have a <unk>
This is true because of many reasons, but I tell you about everything, because my voice was <unk> and Feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it an incident to deal with what happened.
A few kids told me when I was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this for a girl.
They treated me as though it was nothing.
I started to believe that it was nothing.
And then my voice, and after all I didn't bother to believe that something could matter.
But I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I was <unk> in a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and the women who looked like me and understood what it meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin of it.
I read the words of women who showed me that it was nothing.
I learned to write like them, and I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing and <unk> I also discovered that if I was a little brave, another woman I could hear and see me and realize that none of us is nothing that the world is trying to tell us that we are.
On one hand, I have the power to do anything.
And in the other, I hold the <unk> reality.
I'm a <unk> <unk> I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way to think, what I mean and what I do, without abandoning everything that makes me human.
I hope we can all do the same thing.
I hope that we could all be a little courageous, when you need to be a bit of such a <unk>
Just after Christmas last year, <unk> children in California had <unk> to have visited <unk> or being exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, <unk> over 100 children in <unk>
And one of the things that is <unk> from this outbreak is that the <unk> that may be terrible for a child with a <unk> immune system, is one of the most <unk> diseases in the world.
There is an effective vaccine against this for more than a century ago, but a lot of the children involved in the <unk> outbreak had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something supposed to be <unk> autism.
But a moment, it was not the article that unleashed on autism and vaccines and <unk> and marked by being an fraud, by the British Medical Medical
It doesn't believe most intelligent scientists that the vaccine cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but most of the parents around the world are still <unk> that vaccines will put in risk to their children from having autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the estimates of autism in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very bizarre disease.
The few psychologists and pediatricians who had heard of her all their professional life without seeing one case.
For decades, the prevalence of prevalence were still driven by only three or four children per <unk>
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started to <unk>
<unk> of funds like <unk> <unk> refer to autism as an epidemic as if it could be <unk> from another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If you're not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people at the Centers for Disease Control to Atlanta what's going on, they tend to be based on phrases like <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> to explain these <unk> numbers.
But that kind of language doesn't <unk> the fears of a young mother who seeks the face of their two-year-old son.
If the diagnostic criteria had to figure out why they were so <unk> in the beginning?
Why were the cases of autism as hard to find before the <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened is has less to do with the slow progress and <unk> of science that with the seductive power of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, the doctors told a story about what autism is and how it was discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global health.
There was a second more accurate story of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinic.
This second story tells us everything about how we get here and where we have to go.
And the first story begins with a child psychiatrist <unk> Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins Hospital in <unk> <unk> published a paper article that describes 11 young patients who appeared <unk> worlds and <unk> people around them, even their own parents.
They could have fun for hours waving the hands of their faces, but they were <unk> <unk> as when he didn't put his favorite picture in his usual place without knowing it.
On the base of the patients treated in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
By the 1950s, as the main authority of the world in the subject, stated that I had seen less than 150 true cases of their syndrome as we <unk> the <unk> of places as far as South Africa.
This is actually not surprisingly, because the criteria of <unk> for the diagnosis of autism was very <unk>
For example, <unk> giving that diagnosis to <unk> but now we know that epilepsy, it's very common in autism.
Once it was <unk> that he had turned nine of every 10 children sent by other doctors to their doctor's office to be autistic without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart, but part of his theories weren't <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of child <unk> caused by cold <unk> and <unk>
These kids, he said, they've kept carefully in a fridge <unk>
At the same time, though, <unk> I noticed that some of his young patients had special abilities that cluster in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the kids in your clinic could distinguish between 18 <unk> before I turned the two years.
When his mother put one of his favorite records -- he correctly said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, claiming things like the children were simply <unk> what they had heard of their parents <unk> desperately for winning their approval.
As a result, autism became a source of shame for the families, and two generations of autistic kids were sent to institutions for their own good, turning into invisible to the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s, the researchers started to test the theory of <unk> that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> video psychologist psychologist in London, thought the <unk> theory of <unk> was pretty stupid.
She and her husband John was warm and <unk> and they had a deep autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a little girl like <unk> <unk> without special education, and without access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To stand for the National Service Service, they needed more resources for the autistic kids and their families, <unk> and their colleague Judith and they decided to do something that should have done 30 years before.
They launched a study of autism in the general population.
<unk> a suburb from London called <unk> to try and find the children people are in the community.
What you saw clearly made the model of <unk> was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more <unk> and diverse.
Some kids couldn't speak at all, while others were <unk> in their <unk> <unk> in dinosaurs or in the <unk> of <unk>
But in the other way, these kids didn't fit nice and <unk> as <unk> said <unk> and saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
At first, they were lost to try to make sense of their data.
How did nobody ever noticed about these kids before?
But then I found out, I found a reference to an article published in German <unk> the next year to the article in <unk> and then <unk> buried under the cinders of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> knew about this article of competition, but I avoided <unk> <unk> in his own work.
There was no translation in English, but luckily, the <unk> husband was talking German, and he <unk> him for her.
The document does an alternative history of autism.
His author was a man called Hans <unk> who ran an integrated clinic with a school in Vienna, in the 1930s.
<unk> ideas for teaching children with learning differences were <unk> even for contemporary standards.
The morning in his clinic started with music classes, and the kids followed their games, the afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, Asperger's as disability as disability for life that we needed <unk> and <unk> spaces for the course of all life.
Instead of treating kids in their clinic like patients, had called them their little teachers, and he turned to help in the development of education that were especially right for them.
<unk> had seen autism as a diverse continuum that included an amazing variety of childhood and disability.
He believed that autism and the autistic traits were common, and they have always been, looking at this continuum of this continuum in historic <unk> as the awkward social scientist and the <unk> professor.
He was beyond even to say, for success in science and art, an ounce of autism is critical.
<unk> and Judith found that <unk> was wrong with autism was <unk> so that the parents were <unk>
Over the next few years, they worked with the American Association of <unk> to expand the criteria of the diagnosis that reflect the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
At the end of the 1980s and early '90s, their changes in <unk> by replacing the limited model of <unk> for a broad <unk> <unk>
These changes didn't fall in <unk>
<unk> when I <unk> and Judith worked backstage and <unk> these <unk> people around the world see an adult adult for the first time.
Before I came out of <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a small circle, <unk> for experts knew what the autism, but after the <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> with four <unk> <unk> and <unk> and parents from the world knew what the autism was.
At the same time, we were introduced the first clinical trials to use to diagnose autism.
It didn't have to have a connection with that little piece of experts to make a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a network effect, a perfect storm of autism.
The number of diagnoses started to <unk> just like predicted <unk> and <unk> in fact they expected that it was that they were making the people with autism, and their families finally supported the support and services that are <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blame vaccines for the increase in <unk> and a simple, powerful, and <unk> a credible and <unk> theory as bad as the autism theory was <unk>
If the current estimate of the preventing disease that one in 68 children in the United States are in the spectrum, it's right, the <unk> are one of the largest <unk> groups.
In the last few years, people have joined on the Internet to reject the idea that the puzzles for solving the new advances -- doctors, <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way to understand <unk> is to think about terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with Windows doesn't mean it's cut.
According to <unk> standards, the normal human brain is easily <unk> social <unk> and they suffer from a attention deficit to details.
<unk> people are really hard to live in a world that was not built for them.
70 years later, we're still reaching <unk> that believed that <unk> for the most autism aspects of autism are in the understanding of teachers, employers with capacity, communities with capacity, communities, and parents with faith in their children.
An autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once once said, "We need all the hands on deck for <unk> the <unk>
As we <unk> toward an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to deal with the challenges that we face as a society.
We cannot afford to waste a brain.
Thank you.
