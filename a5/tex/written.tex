  \item To check that my implementation of highway network is correct, I printed out and verified the shape of all intermediate layers. In addition, I manually input the weights and biases of $\mathbf{W}_{\text{proj}}$ and $\mathbf{W}_{\text{gate}}$ and compared the final result with the result I got by doing the computation step by step in numpy. I also asserted that the shape of the final output was correct.
